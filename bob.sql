If you don\'t already know I play lead guitar in the bands Savatage and The Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Savatage is still together folks, we are just not as busy as some of you would like at the moment! I have been with Savatage a very long time...my first tour was in support of the CD \"Hall Of The Mountain King\". The following CD was entitled \"Gutter Ballet\". The video for this song is played all the time on VH1 Classics. The band has sold millions of CD\'s and played for hundreds of thousands of fans world-wide. In 1995 I released a CD with Savatage singer Jon Oliva called Doctor Butcher. The CD was just re-released last year with new material world-wide on Black Lotus Records. Also in 1995 Savatage released a CD called \"Dead Winter Dead\". On this CD was a song called \"Christmas Eve Sarajevo-12/24\". This instrumental song was the spring board for the multi platinum Trans-Siberian Orchestra. I play lead guitar and M/C the live shows. We finished our 7th sold out tour...this year it was all in arenas...Madison Square Garden (Extra cool this year because our good friend Joan Jett came onstage and played \"I Love Rock And Roll\" with us during the encore!!), Palace in Detroit, etc. The last tour we sold over 700,000 tickets!\r\n\r\nIn January of 2004 I began pre-production for my very first solo CD ever. Recording began in February. \r\n\r\nJeff Plate took care of the drumming duties, Dave Z the bass and Paul Morris the keyboards and piano.\r\n\r\nThe CD was recorded at Spin Studios in Astoria, NYCity. I produced the CD with co-producer/engineer Nik Chinboukas. The recording and mixing were finished in May of 2004. I then flew to Athens, Greece for the mastering and CD photo shoot. Many of the phots you see here are from the shoot. Thanks to Seth at Seth Design!! Because of the abundance of material I decided to record 30 songs. There are 2 CDs recorded. Faces and God Damn War. \r\n\r\nIn August of 2004 I flew to Germany to be a special guest for Doro Pesch at the 15th Anniversary of Wacken. The premier Heavy Metal Festival in Europe. I played 3 songs with Doro and her Classic Metal Orchestra. The performance was very memorable. The next night I also appeared as a special guest with Saxon. I got to play Denim and Leather with the band. As a huge fan, this was a great honor! I have been blessed to have so many great friends, I even got invited onstage to play \"Killed By Death\" with Motorhead in Austria!!! Those guys are my favorite Rock and Roll Stars!!!\r\n\r\nThe first single for Faces was released on September 1st, 2004 in Europe. It was called The Mold. It contained 3 songs from the release and 2 unreleased bonus tracks. It was a limited edition that I believe it has just about sold out everywhere!\r\n\r\nI also released an EP called \"Music Man\". This CD has a few unreleased holiday songs I recorded. The sample for the one song \"What Child Is This?\" was downloaded over 300,000 on my web-site www.chriscaffery.com. The site is really cool and very active, our message board community is now over 3,350 people and growing rapidly. I keep studio diaries and daily thoughts there too as well as the main site which features many things including my photos, diaries and recipies!!!\r\n\r\nOn September 11th 2004 I headed to Florida to rehearse for a WOMD/Savatage appearance as the headliner of the Prog Power festival in Atlanta. The show was to feature Jon Oliva, former Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens, original Savatage drummer Steve Wacholz and myself. We were called Weapons of Mass Destruction because although we were to play all Savatage material, it was not all of the members of the current Savatage line-up.\r\n\r\nZak Stevens had a terrible accident the week prior to the show and lost part of his right middle finger. He was unable to appear. The show then featured the first lead vocal performance for myself ever. I sang Edge of Thorns and Power of the Night. The show was sold for months and the whole weekend was a ton of fun!\r\n\r\nI went back in the studio in early 2005 to finish the GDWar CD. The results were WARPED!!! This CD was released in Europe in June 2005, Sept. in the US. It is the full length version of my WAR CD! The CD contains 6 unreleased songs, one sung by Jon Oliva! It was a lost Doctor Butcher track called \"Iraq Attack.\" It is in stores in the USA and the rest of the world right now! I am currently working on new material for my next CD. I am going to call it \"Pins and Needles\". \r\n\r\nI did some European and American touring in support of \"Faces\" and \"WARPED\". The European tuor was in support of the legendary Metal Church. The US was a 3 band bill consisting of Jon Oliva\'s Pain and Ripper Owen\'s new band Beyond Fear. It was great to get out and play my solo stuff live. \"Pisses Me Off\" is always the crowd favorite!!!\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bands I listed I have recorded with or written songs for many bands and artists including Circle II Circle, John West, Joe Lynn Turner, Metalium, Eidolon, Jon Oliva\'s Pain and more...For a complete list of my discography visit this page. http://www.chriscaffery.com/discography.htm I have also had a few special guest appearances in many friends DVD\'s including Cradle of Filth and Doro! \r\n\r\nOn February 8th of 2006 I will enter the studio once again! I hope to have Pins out in October...in the meantime....My CD\'s are finally up on I Tunes if you are interested in downloading the samples you hear or the entire playlist! http://www.apple.com/itunes/ I will be launching a new ChrisCaffery.com soon! Keep an eye out! Thanks for all of your support!!!

Spring brought the national release of his first commercial mixed CD, Centaur Entertainment&rsquo;s official 2004 Orlando Gay Days CD (which he has subsequently been the mixmaster on the 2005 &amp; 2006 version and has been offered the 2007 CD compilation as well). The national exposure continued with Randy spinning at Denver&rsquo;s A Weekend in OZ, Palm Springs&rsquo; White Party, and Austin&rsquo;s Perfect Day. July found him in Fire Island Pines manning the turntables at Bliss, a spectacular day party that he also produced with partners Michael Metts of Drury Design Dynamics and Patty Rosado. In September, Randy spun Fairgrounds, an evening for the LGBT community at Six Flags Great Adventure.  He returned again in 2006 to share the turntables with one of his mentors, DJ Max Rodriguez. 2005 continued the momentum with Randy manning the turntables at 3 of New York City&rsquo;s biggest dance events: the Saint-at-Large Escape To Candyland; the Saint at Large Black Party&ndash;Lucha Libre: Rites XXVI; and the 19th Annual Heritage of Pride Gay Pride Pier Dance. And things just keep getting better. In 2006, Randy will took his third turn as mixmaster on Centaur&rsquo;s annual Gay Days CD for Orlando Gay Day.  DJRB, along with the BetBoyz Team, in association with Centaur Music and GayDays.com developed his first ever promotional tour &ndash; Gay Days Tour 2006.  This was also the year that Randy took his music to the sea on both the &ldquo;R Family Cruise&rdquo; and the &ldquo;RSVP Mexican Riviera Cruise&rdquo;. Beginning May 22, you can how hear Randy&rsquo;s mixed sets on every Monday evening on G.I.R.L. (GayInternetRadioLive.com).  In addition to all that Randy is proud to have been elected to the illustrious Billboard Panel, as part of a nationwide panel that ultimately is responsible for the charting of all the dance music released in the United States.  To cap off 2006 DJRB &amp; The Gay Days Tour was very honored to have been voted &ldquo;Best Circuit Tour of 2006&rdquo; by the members of JustCircuit.com.

Currently, he is a resident DJ at Splash Bar in NYC, with guest residencies at Pavilion/Blue Whale in Fire Island Pines, Pure in Philadelphia &amp; Paramount Ballroom in Provincetown, MA. In addition to paying the rent, Randy also pays it forward, regularly donating his talents as DJ and music producer.

Over the years, Randy has donated his services to raise funds for a number of other organizations including Dancers Responding To AIDS, New York Theater Workshop, and VisualAIDS. In 2001, Bettis teamed up with writer/arranger David Boyd to form BetBoyz NYC, a music/event production company. In the fall of 2002, Emerge Records honored BetBoyz by choosing their very first remix, the &quot;BetBoyz Vocal Dub&quot; mix of Taylor Daynes&#39; &quot;How Many&quot;, to be included on the commercial release of the CD maxi single. Recent projects include remixes for Aussie artist Karen Jacobsen, Broadway star Billy Porter, hot singing sensation Brian Kent and Junior Vasquez recording artist Jason Walker.

The two were at a crossroad in regard to which musical project to take on next. In the studio background, Mike was playing an old demo tape of a vocalist who sounded very intense and somewhat uncharactoristic of many other male vocalists. Dan says, \"Wow, who\'s that singing?\" \"That\'s \'The Eyes\'\", says Mike \'The Eyes\', or Steve Shurelian, is a west coast based singer who has worked with Cottrill for several decades.\r\n\r\nThe project began to take shape when, during the following evening, \'The Eyes\' knocked on Mike\'s front door, unannounced, and out of the blue. He had made the drive from Seattle to Philadelphia. Steve surprised everyone with his presence, as he was basically out of touch with the others for over a year. He wanted to lay down some tracks and capture some of the music he had been working on. Philadelphia bassist Rick Terway adds melodic lines to the mix to complete the project called Eggmen.\r\n\r\nDrawing on their combined influences, the Eggmen weave an intense, lyrical journey through different genres of rock music.<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30\">Join Eggmen\'s discussion</a>',1,'',0,''),(1856,1924,'Placid',1,61,'www.placidweb.com','','','\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">Moody orchestration mixes with indie rock guitar and solid three part harmony. <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 /><st1:place>Nottingham</st1:place> guitar trio putting together layered anthemic tunes, exploring a Sgt Pepper era after gigging under different guises for nearly 10 years.<?xml:namespace prefix = o /><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><br/>Placid are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Paul Morton&nbsp;- Vocals, Bass, Acoustic Guitar, Piano<br/>Mark Godfrey - Vocals, Lead Guitars, Mandolin<br/>Chris Morton - Drums, Vocals, Orchestration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>A classic three-piece reunion of a Beatles inspired band turned Metallica tribute, come full circle back to their&nbsp;late nineties&nbsp;line up, once again writing original contemporary guitar music fuelled by thick vocal harmonies and killer melodies.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Placid cut their teeth on the </span><st1:place><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Midlands</span></st1:place><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> pub scene throughout the late 90s as rock/metal band \'The Calm\', playing their own selection of 90s rock and similarly inspired original tracks.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then still in their teens, their Beatles roots mixed with the likes of Nirvana, Metallica and Guns N&#8217; Roses which, whilst proving popular on the local scene, ultimately saw them straying from mainstream guitar music and the members going their separate ways by 2000.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After Paul&#8217;s stint fronting Metallica tribute band \'Moletallica\', the remnants of that band formed the first version of Placid with Chris joining on drums.<span>&nbsp; </span>Placid had some success and local interest in their new restyled approach to four-piece acoustic rock.

Hailing from Miami, Dante brings with him an incomparable talent for writing catchy rock and roll that nonetheless resonates with thoughtfulness and honest emotional presentation.<br/>\r\nSinger/songwriter Robert Dante discovered and began developing his talent for playing piano at the early age of 6.  As a teenager, he acquired a taste for early jazz standards, inspiring him to further explore his creativity.  Robert trained in both classical and jazz theory and performance, studying under the tutelage of renowned jazz pianist Tamir Hendlemen.  His exceptional talent earned him numerous, prestigious awards and scholarships including the following: The David Alpert Scholarship at Los Angeles City College, The Leslie P. Clausen Scholarship, also at Los Angeles City College, and The National Honor Society at the University of Central Florida.<br/>\r\nRobert Dante\'s credits include composing and producing soundtracks for such independent films as \"Bloodline\" and \"Little Things\".  He has also enjoyed working with a variety of internationally known artists such as Nas, Ray Ruiz, Salaam Remi, Faith Evans, and Matchbox 20.  With an eclectic variety of influences and a broad range of well-developed talents, Robert Dante\'s music displays both intelligence and sensitivity with an infectious pop element to support its potential for mass appeal.  Inspired by the deep harmonies of THE BEATLES, the melancholic moods of SARAH MALACHLAN, and the funky, soulful nature of FIONA APPLE, Robert Dante offers a remarkably ambitious and delicious cocktail of musical taste.  His amazing vocal range and passionately melodic piano playing delivers a unique sound that both inspires and intoxicates the senses.  Robert Dante is a true artist on many levels whose talents are numerous, and whose potential is limitless.<br/><br/>Check out the video:<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;\"><br/>\r\n</span>\r\n<object height=\"350\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/d_92AFcBIs4\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><embed \r\nsrc=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/d_92AFcBIs4\" \r\ntype=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" \r\nheight=\"350\"/></object><br/><br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28\">Join Robert Dante\'s discussion</a><br/>',0,'',0,''),(390,408,'Slowest Train in the World',1,17,'','912 Riverside Drive','','You should probably listen to this alone, with headphones, in a fetal position, under a table, in the dark.

These three guys have now spent more than a decade in the high Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico, honing their skills and defining what they believe in, while absorbing the music, language and culture of their latin friends. <br />\r\n</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many years of friendship, jam sessions, and performing every genre imaginable in other groups, Psychostasia came together in January 2007...three Mexicanized American rockers and one Mexican drummer with a passion for ROCK.

You get sweet riffs (a la Floyd) one minute and a raw and ruthless adrenaline rush (Metallica-esque) the next. <br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melodies and lyrics reflect modern-day conflicts and challenges ... realism infused with a dose of optimism. Expect a lot of ups and downs, multiple textures, rhythm changes, and climactic endings,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the band, &quot;The tracks are raw and potent, from the cradle to the grave.

Cherry St.','618-643-3740','I have been back on the stage for three years solid. I love it! This is my job. It is not a nine to five job, it is twenty-four/seven. I was given this talent at birth. It is passed down from my dad, he is the original rocker. When music is born into you it is different from being learned. I am not saying it is any less or any more, but you can not deny what is in your body, mind, and soul. You can not put it down and pick it up when you feel like it. My mom would tell me stories of when my dad would have jam sessions at our house (when she was pregnant with me) and I would not stop jumping around inside her. I suppose that reflects my on stage performance. I am an entertainer, very energetic where there is music I can\'t sit still. I want the audience to leave with a smile on their face and wondering where I will be next. It\'s not about the traveling, it\'s not about the money, it is about the next show and the performance. It is where I can best convey my feeling and love for music. My musical experiences growing up vary from both ends of the spectrum. My mom would listen to traditional country, and my dad played southern rock. I soon developed my own favorites ranging from Barbra Streisand, Frank Sintra, Nat King Cole, to Gun\'s N Roses, Poison, to The Judd\'s, and of course Garth Brooks. My voice has been described as versatile, so the question has been asked many times,why country? I am country! I was raised and still live in a small town in Southern Illinois. It is what I know. The lyrics and melodies of every country song are familiar to me. I can relate to all of the songs on country radio. I\'ve either seen it, heard it, or done it. Some of the songs are so clever that I laugh out loud. That is the type of music I want to put out there. When you hear it, you know it, cause you\'ve lived it. I have a husband, and a daughter. They too, have a love for music. We have yet to see all of my daughters music abilities but they are there. My entire family supports my music career 100%. My mom had me in the studio recording a demo at age thirteen. Of course at thirteen it\'s is more their decision than yours. You come to learn though, they have your best interest at heart. I have won numerous awards, and talent shows. I was in choir in school and sang in church. I have been in many Country Showdowns, and performed all over the US. In the summer of 2005 I opened for Buddy Jewell, and last summer I was invited to do the Taste Of Chicago, and performed in front of a crowd of 10-15,000 people. I opened for Phil Vasser, Jo Dee Messina, and Shedaisy. It has been the highlight of my career thus far. As I continue on my journey, there are ups and downs. I continue my trips back and forth to Nashville to try and soak up as much knowledge as I can. I have met so many interesting people that travel the same road, we all have a dream that we are striving to make a reality. Being from a small town, a dry county, population 2500, a town well away from any major city, I SIT. The internet, the phone, and snail mail are my tools. Why would I pick this dream? For love, for passion, and maybe I\'m a little crazy. It\'s my music, my most passionate form of communication to those around me. I am not alone, we are an army. Performers in small towns everywhere. To our right and to our left are those who believe in us. Those whom we trust to tell us we are doing this for the right reasons. Why when there are so many searching for that #1 hit and break into the music biz, why would we pursue this dream, day after day, relentlessly? Because we love it, its our life, it is born into us. We eat, sleep, and drink lyrics and melodies. I wouldn\'t trade it for anything, and there are a lot easier roads to take. There\'s room, if you have enough determination and persistence to shove your way in. I am a performer--make room!

We\r\nstarted off with a guitar in Anthony\'s bedroom, a fake drum set and maracas. We\r\nwanted it so much that we did anything (ditch friends, families&#8212;at times,\r\ngirlfriends, etc). And guess what happened? Eventually, as we grew as friends,\r\npartners, and musicians, our music, equipment, priorities and musical ability\r\ngot stronger and better. This led to our first signing with Mushroom\r\nProductions (our first Indie label). Now, here we are today in the year 2007\r\ndoing what we love while growing and learning in trying to turn this dream into\r\na reality. With self-booked tours and shows past and present, we bring it all\r\nto the table. We finally realized we were one step closer to this dream when we\r\ngot the opportunity to open up for much lager bands such as The New Cities, Surplus\r\nSons, The Pettit Project, Socialight and Cauterize. During the process we have\r\nreleased one demo, and a new album (full-length) in the works.

The person who writes all our songs hasn\'t had a working television in his house since January, 1982. Scary, isn\'t it! That could explain the somewhat retro, rather experimental feel to the music, which has been described as sounding somewhere between Buddy Holly, The Ramones, The B-52s, and They Might Be Giants. This CD is an object lesson in how warped and depraved a television-starved mind can get.<br/><br/>And that\'s not all! To make matters worse, since no self-respecting human would stoop low enough to play this stuff, he suckered four poor, innocent cartoon characters into recording his music. Cartoon characters have it tough enough as it is, with people laughing at them all the time, without having to be subjected to this!

After\r\nexperimenting with an Acidhead, an Alcoholic and a Mullet-master in the\r\ndrummer slot, everyone came to their senses.

For the first time in nearly 2\r\nyears the band felt right and the music really began to take shape into\r\nwhat it is today. With Eric and Andrew concentrating on lyrics and\r\nmelody, Foretold began writing music at a much faster pace and recorded\r\na 4 track E.P just three months after the transition.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNine months later, the band had played every major local\r\nmusic venue in the Baltimore area. Recently Mike Kane was added to the\r\nlineup as a guitarist and backup singer. Mike added production\r\nexperience and his connections have allowed the band has played on a TV\r\nshow against drunk-driving that aired several times weekly in May.

I&rsquo;ve been singing and playing bass for over three decades now... I started by  playing the drums at the age of 8 in 1970... I found myself venturing out in the 80&#39;s grabbing songs of impact, and alot of hard rockers, now finding myself mellowing out a little...    I&#39;ve spent 15 years as a studio musician, and assistant to the engineer. Singing, playing Bass, mixing new ones, old ones, covers, and originals. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #990000\">We were in the studio one day in Ohio and this black kid comes walking in. Tom the engineer looks at me and says, &quot;do you know who that is?&quot; I said &quot;have no clue&quot;. He said thats Anthony the drummer for &quot;The Back Street Boys.&quot; All of you have heard of the all boy pop band right... Well Tom said, why don&#39;t you have Anthony put the drums on your new song &quot;My Life&quot; well I&#39;m thinking (is this kid any good.) So Tom asked Anthony, and he said, &quot;SURE,  why not...&quot; So we get the tape out, play the song one time and Anthony says &#39;&#39;OK lets do it...&#39;&#39; I said what!? And he starts walking to the drum kit in the next room!!! Now keep in mind he was listening to a bad live recording of the song in it&#39;s infancy with a bad drummer on it! I said to Tom, there ain&#39;t no way this guy&#39;s gonna do this after only hearing it one time and do it live all the way though... Tom just smiled and said &quot;WE&#39;RE ROLLIN&quot; then laughed... So heres the deal, if you take the time to listen to &quot;My Life&quot; it&#39;s Anthony on drums and he did it the first take, NO KIDDING!!! It took me 3 months to write this song and Houdini learns it in 5 minutes then plays his ass off at the end... Oh well, your the best Anthony.......</span>  I grew up in a big city in Ohio (The Great White North!) and found myself always listening to a band called Rush in the late 70&#39;s. Buying a $50.00 bass at a local flea market I went home to see if I could play long enough to learn at least one song all the way through... I picked an easy Chicago tune called 25 or 6 to 4, and figured it out after about an hour of playing, but man my fingers had enough ! ! ! Then I knew I could move on to Rush&#39;es Workin Man... I was only 16 at the time and it was Geddy Lee from Rush that inspired me to write my own songs. In 1980 I discovered a band called &quot;Journey&quot; I was hooked, it was then I decided to jump into the music biz head first and learn every song, on every album that Journey ever put out...  So in 1980 I joined my first band. The bio of the band I jumped into was intense ! The band ended up learning over 56 songs in less then 6 months, which put me on center stage to be the front man since all the other guys in the band wouldn&#39;t sing, (only backup...) It was then I had my homework cut out for me, trying to learn the bass lines, memorize the lyrics, then trying to put both parts together was difficult at the time but I never really thought about how difficult it was, I just wanted to keep rockin... The Harmonic Distortion CD was really never to be... It was two years ago when I had an idea to rekindle my old passion for singing. After a long four year break from my music, I decided to sing an old love song by Elton John called &quot;Your Song&quot; and give it to my girlfriend as a gift of gratitude. When I finished with the mixing at the studio, I wanted more... So I kept singing and thus become &quot;some&quot; of the songs listed on here .... Titling the CD was then easy, the mixing is something I wouldn&#39;t wish on anyone!  Thats why we called it (dont try this @ home.)  Geddy Lee from Rush, Rik Emmett from Triumph, Klaus Meine from the Scorpions, and Steve Perry from Journey, &quot;My so-called teachers&quot;... Thanx to Primetime recording studio where &quot;Lovin Someone, My Yyz for Geddy Lee, Vital Farewell, My life, Love of a lifetime, and Cruel Passages,&quot; were recorded, but mixed at my studio Stealth Sound &amp; Recording. Also thanks to my studio players Scott sheppard and Dave Elgin on drums, Dave Chilson (Old 80&#39;s Guy) and Bobby Wilson on Guitars, my parents for their tolerance of all the loud music when I was growing up, and my children for having my loud screaming vocals in there face as they were growing up..... And YOU for taking the time to listen ! ! !  And most of all, Uncle  Les...  ROCK ON BROTHERS !

He was then adopted in 1990 where it wasnt long until he discovered the world of music and where he began to learn as much as he could about music 24/7. In 99 he discoverd trance music and he was hooked. He bought every cd imaginable and learned as much about trance music.Come eight grade Damian took up Turtablism for about a year before he got into just hardcore mixing. He then took up the name (D.J. Paradox). His Arsenal comes With Two Stanton Direct Drive Turntables, Two Numark Cdx\'x, And A Behringer DJX 700 Mixer. What is it about his mixing at a show maybe its his connection throguh his music to the people or the connection of the people to him. Whatever it is when D.J. Paradox is performing its a site to see. When i had a chance to ask damian about waht it is he looks for at a venue he said \" I look for a vibe and then i build the energy up from there\". Paradox has always found his groove no matter where he goes and performs it just comes so natural to him In early 2002 he started to work as a dj sharing his passion for trance music with his community.Then in 2004 he started producing music by starting with mix cds and then ion 2005 he started producing his own trance music. His debut album True Trance will be released in a few months. He also is working with Axion another Trance Producer in hopes of releasing a collaboration cd sometime next year. <br/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=70\" target=\"_blank\">Join Paradox\'s discussion</a>',1,'',0,''),(502,546,'tim pont',10,48,'www.myspace.com/timpontmusic','','','I have been playing in bands for as long as I care to remember untill about a year ago I decided to put the electric down for a while and give the acoustic a go.

His Dad rarely played it and after a year it sat in the corner of their living room collecting dust. One autumn Saturday morning Anthony thought he would give it a try. His dad tuned it and showed him a couple of chords. By the time the next weekend came around he was sure that he wanted to learn how to play. They were not a wealthy family so his dad bought him a simple chord book, there would be no lessons. <br />\r\nHe made up his mind he was going to practice at least one hour every night. He practiced every night for a month and soon found that he had no desire to learn other peoples songs. He started stringing chords together and humming melodies. Anthony had never attempted to write anything before, but one night he sat down and put lyrics to a chord run he had been playing over and over. He got up the nerve to sing it for his mom and that&rsquo;s where things started for Anthony at age 13. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"book antiqua,palatino\" size=\"3\" color=\"#3366ff\">Anthony has formed a couple of bands over the years, Wilderness, Robinson Vail and Graysville Skyview. Unfortunately they did not work out too well as most of the members wanted to do covers. Anthony did not want this, he wanted to write and play his own material. He recorded his first cd in 1996 called An Eyeful of Words. It wasn&rsquo;t until 2001 that he picked up his guitar again and recorded Beneath a Wounded Sky. Anthony has recently finished recording All Lights &nbsp;on the Myth, his 3<sup>rd</sup> cd and is now working on his 4<sup>th</sup> called&nbsp; Somewhere Out there, which he hopes to release this summer. <br />\r\n</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"book antiqua,palatino\" size=\"3\" color=\"#3366ff\">Anthony believes that perhaps music is the one common ground that we all can share.

He Felt It Was The Only Thing He Was Good At. His Purpose Was To Prove Everyone Who Said He Wouldn\'t Make It.... Wrong. Mainly His Mother. But Losing His Mother At The Age Of 13 Would Force Him To Set Out For A New Goal In Life.So He Focused On Rapping And Started To Create A New Purpose To Do The Trade And That Purpose Was Called Passion. He Discovered The Name Syck-Ness Because He Wanted A Name That Had A Meaning Behind It And Not Just A Name Anybody Could Think Of. There Are A Few Reasons For The Name. 1. Is A Simple Reason Its Because Everybody THat Heard Him Rhyme Would Say That He Was Sick. 2. Was Because When He Rapped Word About His Skills Spread From One Person To Another, Like A Sickness. And 3. Is Because Every Time They Came Out With A Cure For A disease A New Disease A Worse Disease Would Arise So Every Time They Come Out With A Song To Cure One Of His Songs (Make A Better Song) He Comes Out With One Thats Even Better Then The Last One He Put Out. After Finding His Name He Would Spend The Rest Of His Time Battling, Writting,Freestyling, And Recording To Get A Buzz On The Streets And In The Music World.

While attending Lynwood High School he was part of many organizations such as Gospel Choir, <br/>Entertainment Club, Marching Band, Jazz Band, The Lynwood High School Chorus, and Stage Crew.&nbsp; As a member of these organizations, he learned the fundamentals of live recording, lighting and sound, and motion picture/audio synchronization.&nbsp; With music embedded in his soul, he started producing music for a local rap group.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t long after teaming up with the group that he started to compose lyric&#8217;s of his own and recorded his very own demo adopting the name \"Mr. DaLicks\".&nbsp; After many, many meetings with A&R directors and record company executives he decided to venture off and start his <br/>own recording company.&nbsp; With the financial help of a family member, he bought a studio and began working on his album.&nbsp; Mr. DaLicks freshman album entitled, &#8220;My Struggles&#8221; has been labeled as a \"G-Funk Classic\".

Smooth, Daz, E White, RBX, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and Jayo Felony and more. To hear his music and see him perform is a marvelous sight to see.&nbsp; He has always known that the music industry and entertaining is where he belongs, so he works very hard to make sure the public sees him and his musical talent as one. <br/></p><br/>\r\n<p><br/></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=79\" target=\"_blank\">Join Mr. Dalicks\' discussion</a><br/></p>',1,'',0,''),(525,565,'Power 2 Move',5,27,'www.myspace.com/power2move','','','<font color=\"#990000\"><strong>Power 2 Move</strong> </font>\r\n<p><font color=\"#990000\"><b>Power 2 Move</b> is the dynamic duo of producer <b>Themi Charalambous</b> (from Electrik Pulse) and vocal powerhouse <b>Amber Dirks</b>, who have brought their unique talents and extensive musical experience to the table to form the hottest, fastest rising group in the dance music industry today. </font></p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#990000\"><b>Themi&#8217;s</b> remix of <b>Chris &#8220;The Greek&#8221; Panaghi&#8217;s</b> &#8220;The Time&#8221; soared to the #5 spot on the Billboard Club Play Dance Chart in 2007 as did his remix of <b>Chris &#8220;The Greek&#8221; Panaghi</b> track&#8220;Pump&#8221;.

And if I did tell you that, would it make\r\nyou like me more? If so then I have failed as an artist. You see I\r\nwanted you to come feel what I was thinking, or to be part of my mind\r\nfor about 3:50 sec or so, just enough for you to hang out and\r\nunderstand the journey. I am not the kind of person who sits around all\r\nday and writes song after song after song. The songs usually take some\r\ntime to form in my head or on paper. When I sit down to write, I\r\nusually want to work out some issue that is unresolved. This could be\r\nabout me, but it most likely could be about you. Maybe something you\r\nsaid to me yesterday that has made me think things are not as they\r\nseem. The Queen of paper trails sounds like a great way to describe me\r\nwhen it comes to the way I compose lyrics. I may write something one\r\nway and feel it&#8217;s not quite right and will cross out idea, after idea,\r\nafter idea. Any piece of scrap paper will do. This means I could have a\r\nridiculous mound of paper by the time I finish a song. A piece of paper\r\nmay only contain one line of lyrics. Words seem to come and go so\r\nquickly in my head and I refuse to take the time to write in a linear\r\nfashion. I have lost brilliant lyrics because I didn&#8217;t have a piece of\r\npaper and pen handy. I think sticky notes were Gods gift to women. I\r\ndon&#8217;t have any musical influences. In fact sometimes I will go without\r\nlistening to music for days, and I very rarely listen to the radio. I\r\nam a misfit in a band of musical Pop Culture goo roos. There are days\r\nwhen music distracts my own creating process, and times when it\r\ninspires. When I finish a piece I very rarely go back to it. I try and\r\nforget the melody and chord progressions completely so I can be free\r\nand open for a new way of thinking and writing. I fail a lot of times,\r\nwhich makes success taste so much sweeter in the end. I hope you come\r\nvisit me often, on-line and in concert. I hope you feel free to come\r\nand tell me a good story. Everybody needs a good story to save them\r\nfrom their own reality. Who knows, your story could be my next\r\ncreation. And if you love this music, please share it with everyone you\r\nknow.

I play all the instruments, write the lyrics and write all the music parts. I do all the production work myself on my in home studio. I use a Boss BR-1600 CD Workstation. A Focusrrite Trackmaster Pro preamp, a Lexicon MX-400 reverbs and delays unit, a BBE Dual Compressor with built in Sonic Maximizer and a Audio-Technica 3035 microphone for all vocals. I use various effects pedals to achive the Guitars with no preamps (I uesed only my Oldfield Marquis 50) and run the Bass through the BR-1600 amps with no preamps. The only instrument I do not play is drums. For this I use Discrete Drums drum loops that came with the Boss BR-1600.

I remeber one thing we always had and never ran out of and that was music and lots of love my mother loved to listen to blues every chance she got so I guess you could say the I grew up on the blues. I remember listening and learning the words to all the songs she played, my sister and brother liked them too, but for me it was more than just listening I became a walking jukebox full of the blues. As a teen I had developed my vocal skills, in school I took any and everything that had to do with music like choir and band. I\'m living the single life and loving it.. Other than singing around the house I joined several Gospel groups. Then I joined my church and <br/>became a member of the choir this is where I really gained alot of exposure I loved it, yet I still longed for something and I believe it was that old&nbsp; trying to resurface The Blues. So I came in contact with some sweet and carring people who heard me sing the blues and said to me, girl you been sittin down on your gift so then I thought to myself let me give this a try so I sat down one day and decided to do some writing and before I knew it I had written 8 songs. I knew this guy kin kin Kinny Miles who composes music and he got busy and came up with the music I needed for my songs, so now I\'m getting ready to go into the studio and record my first CD intitled Tell Me What You wanna Do I\'m really excited about it and believe it can be a success, pray with me and for me.

As much as I&#39;d like to change your mind, I do realize that virtually everyone has labels hung over them and would like to remove them. The truth is we are all larger than the labels people give us to confine and define us.

Instead of defending myself, I would like to give you the opportunity to find out a little about me. \r\nIt&#39;s hard to put your finger around what you&#39;d have to do in order to feel you are a success in life, the answer is different from person to person. For me, I need to use my voice to help, sing words that come from my soul, perform, and never let the passion in me die. I will try to be aware of my impact on others and find ways to improve the lives of those I love. I will always fight to spread light into a world that at times looks very dark, that&#39;s where my phrase &quot;Keep it Burning&quot; came from. That&#39;s also the title I have given to my upcoming album.<br />\r\nWhen writing, I draw from a life filled with great happiness and deep pain. I truly understand many of the struggles facing people in this world today. I know what it&#39;s like to feel abandoned and to feel unloved. Sometimes the only thing you need is to know that someone understands and has been in your situation, that alone can give comfort. \r\nI am truly living the American dream.

Invading all of Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky radio stations, they have played for the likes of Budweiser, Zippo tour, Vh1 Local shot, Radio now, Frogs mountain,&nbsp;Jefferson Hall, &nbsp;and y106 indianas rock station 3 years in a row. Fresh of their 2007 battle of the bands Win, they get to open up for Former national artist, Henry lee summer, and that just shows they can relate to all artist, genre\'s and styles,&nbsp; they dont just play Metal. They have been close to touring with papa roach, and touring Germany, but most battle of the bands, and online voting is tedious, and takes up a whole day without work, kids, and just the other point of life. Practicing 2-3 times a week, and playing out at least once or twice, they manage to stay strong, and focus. If you had to describe Thorn4memory, you would have to say \"(In your face Rock)\" Thats were they would&nbsp;be.&nbsp;In&nbsp;your face, and in the now. &nbsp;So give them some thourough listening, and feel the time, and effort they put into getting better, and doing what it takes to spread their music across the world.&nbsp;They dont dis other bands, but to the bands that&nbsp;know they need work, and i mean alot of&nbsp; work, keep clear&nbsp;of the&nbsp;air waves that could clear up the bands that actually put the time and effort into their craft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock&nbsp;&nbsp;is not all evil. Good is what beholds a brighter future.&nbsp; Rock So&nbsp;Loved the world that he gave his only begotten paycheck just to buy that new fucking guitar.....&nbsp;Rock-n- roll, &nbsp;is not all evil. Good is what beholds a brighter future.&nbsp;Work hard,&nbsp;Fuck the bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorn4Memory Bitches.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=112\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with THORN4MEMORYs fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(547,592,'Justin lanning',1,15,'www.justinlanning.com',' P.O.

This optimistic spirit permeates his debut CD Behind These Eyes. Behind These Eyes references many of the twenty-one year-old Lanning\'s idols: the glossy, power-pop sheen of Bryan Adams; the storytelling prowess of Billy Joel; the classic harmonic sophistication of the Beatles and the Beach Boys; the youthful exuberance of James Blunt; and the energy of blink-182. But like those musical heroes, Justin is his own man, and his personal songs come from a deep emotional well that is unique to him. The debut single \"Take My Breath Away\" perfectly captures the innocence of finding a new love and the overwhelming allure of female beauty. More universal issues are tackled on \"Voices,\" where Lanning takes the listener along his search for meaning in the cosmos, highlighting the depth of his spiritual consciousness as the simple melody gradually builds to a multilayered peak centered on an urgent guitar riff. The album\'s title track encapsulates Lanning\'s uplifting message of self-esteem, personal growth and championing your inner child. But don\'t mistake Lanning\'s honesty and positive vibes as inexperienced or unsophisticated. Los Angeles born and bred, Lanning exudes \'California cool,\' and while his speech is peppered with new age aphorisms like references to spirit guides and light healing, he is a shrewd businessman in full control of his career and destiny. Self-taught from a young age on a variety of instruments, including guitar, piano, bass and drums, Lanning not only writes and performs his songs but also owns the publishing rights and masters and acted as his own A&R rep. Lanning even co- produced two tracks along with seasoned veteran Jeff Bova (Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Joe Cocker) and acted as financial backer for his upcoming album, which features additional songs produced by Steven Miller (Dave Matthews Band, Pink, Mandy Moore) and will be released on Lanning\'s own King George Records with promoRecords is \"named after my father,\" says Lanning, \"for his loving support when I was a young kid, paying for acting classes and driving me to auditions... which, essentially, gave me the jobs that helped to fund my record!\" While finishing the recording of his self-financed debut release Behind These Eyes, Lanning came up short on funds for laying down a few additional vocal tracks. Rather than leaving the record as simply \"good enough,\" he took his Chevy Trailblazer to the pawn shop, and 15 minutes later walked out with just enough cash to finish the tracks. When asked about what he\'s going do for a car, Lanning joked, \"I\'ll just drive my Mom\'s for a while or I\'ll sell a bunch of CDs.\" While he might have to borrow a car for the time being, he is satisfied that his creative vision has been fully realized. Betting his car on his future was a calculated risk for any performer I but Lanning is insistent on maintaining full creative control. The young singer/songwriter puts so much of his heart and soul into the music that he is unwilling to let anyone else water it down. Lanning turned down lucrative offers from several major labels in favor of establishing his own independent label. Lanning sees himself as a multi-media artist as well. A visit to his MySpace highlights the various episodes of justin\'s World, webisodes that feature the life and times of the enthusiastic sprit of Lanning as he heads through a variety of Left Coast adventures. justin\'s World has already gathered a cult following, with tens of thousands of viewers watching each and every episode. To the delight of those online fans, Lanning plans to take his live show on the road in the spring. His electrifying presence on stage is bolstered by his experience as an actor with over 20 commercials and TV shows to his credit, including winning MTV\'s \"Score\" with Ryan Cabrera and a recent role as a murderer on \"CSI: Las Vegas.\" Looking towards the future, Lanning is supremely optimistic. He\'s made a record that he loves; he has a single shipping to radio; he\'s assembled a crack band of players for an upcoming tour in the spring; and surrounded himself with a business team consisting of industry insiders who he now considers friends. Can you think of any better reason to be optimistic? www.JustinLanning.comtion and distribution through MesajBluemoon Recordings.

Cliff St.','860-859-1388','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a fine wine, some things just get better with age. Such is the case with New London County musicians, Geno Champagne and Bill Thibeault. The two&nbsp; played together in a local cover band in the early 70\'s, then drifted apart, each working on and off in different area bands. Then, in early May, 2006, the two crossed paths one night at a local bar, and began discussing music. They decided to get together to possibly do some writing and recording. It turned out to be a magical pairing.&nbsp; Champagne has quite a backlog of song material he had written over the years. Thibeault took a look at some of the material and made some minor changes here and there. The end result is an irresistible&nbsp; mix of rock, folk and country. One of the highlights is a song Geno co-wrote in the early nineties called &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Glory?&#8221; The song was written after the Gulf War, primarily for the Vietnam veterans. The inspiration was the difference in the treatment of the returning war veterans on the home front. The song was also written to be sung by a veteran.&nbsp; Thibeault happens to be a&nbsp; Vietnam veteran, and immediately connected with the song. He is a survivor of the USS Frank E. Evans, a U.S. destroyer which collided with an Australian aircraft carrier, June 3, 1969, which suffered a loss of 74 crewmen. Thibeault has since learned that none of the 74 lost that day are on the Vietnam Wall.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &#8220;Geno and Bill....Wow...This is fantastic...I&#8217;m so glad these guys joined forces...I&#8217;ve been<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fan of both of their separate projects over the&nbsp; years. &#8220;Where&#8217;s The Glory&#8221; is an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excellent tune, and the lyrics will mean so much to so many people.&#8221;....Ron Apicelli,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron&#8217;s Guitars, Groton, CT<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July, 2006, Thibeault had another chance encounter in the same local bar with Andy Stackpole, a professional sound engineer who occasionally did sound for Thibeault&#8217;s band Random Access in the late eighties and early nineties.&nbsp; Stackpole is now a&nbsp; front of the house sound engineer, working for artists such as Living Colour, Mos Def, Busta Rhymes, Steven Segal and many others. When he is not touring he is at home in Norwich, working as a recording engineer. One thing led to another, and in September, 2006, Geno & Bill began recording a four song EP titled &#8220;A Long Time Coming,&#8221; with Stackpole&nbsp; producing and mixing. The CD was released Nov. 27,2006 and is currently available in CT, at The Other Side, 29 Franklin St., Norwich, Mystic Disc, in Mystic, and Tumbleweeds, in Niantic.

It meant that a group begun as a way of having some family fun had been accepted by their peers in the bluegrass world as one of their own. With &#8220;Simple Man,&#8221; the Chapmans prove they are more than worthy of that praise.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">The band&#8217;s musical journey begins in the early 1990s in Colorado where young fiddler John Chapman won a statewide junior division championship in his early teens. Inspired by his son&#8217;s interest in music, Bill took up the banjo and the two started a bluegrass band with some family friends. Eventually John would switch to guitar and begin singing lead vocals. When younger brothers Jeremy and Jason took up mandolin and bass respectively, a hobby turned into a full-on family passion.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">The Chapmans honed their skills through shows at county fairs and bluegrass festivals throughout the 1990s. They moved to the Missouri Ozarks in 1995 to make nationwide travel easier. In 1998 the Chapmans jumped into the national spotlight when they won the International Bluegrass Band Championship held by the Society For the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPBGMA). Along with the critical success of the band&#8217;s first independent album, &#8220;Love&#8217;s Gonna Live Here,&#8221; the win paved the way for the Chapmans to sign a record contract with independent roots and bluegrass label Pinecastle Records.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">The band&#8217;s first album on Pinecastle, &#8220;Notes From Home,&#8221; was produced by IIIrd Tyme Out bassist Ray Deaton and became a critical and commercial success. Besides earning rave reviews from Bluegrass Now and Bluegrass Unlimited, the genre&#8217;s leading publications, &#8220;Notes From Home&#8221; landed in the Top 5 of Bluegrass Unlimited&#8217;s radio chart and was nominated by SPBGMA for Album of the Year.

It also led to the Emerging Artist honor from the IBMA voters, an award the Chapmans say they were sure they had no chance of winning right up until the moment their name was called. </font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">&#8220;Everybody had a grin on their face until about 5 in the morning that night,&#8221; John recalls.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">The hard-won success opened the door for the Chapmans to work with some of their heroes who, it turned out, were just as eager to work with them. </font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">&#8220;One of the most exciting things about our career is all the support we&#8217;ve received from other artists, from our heroes,&#8221; Jeremy says.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">Producer Darren Vincent, brother of fellow Missourian and bluegrass innovator Rhonda Vincent, raised the bar for quality and musical craftsmanship on the recording without compromising the Chapmans&#8217; artistic vision. Union Station guitarist Ron Block, whom John describes as &#8220;my personal guitar hero,&#8221; plays backing guitar on three songs, &#8220;The Photograph,&#8221; &#8220;Runaway Kind&#8221; and &#8220;Sometimes You Just Can&#8217;t Win.&#8221; Singer Sonja Isaacs, guitarist Rob Ickles, and fiddlers Stuart Duncan, Andy Leftwich and Aubrey Haynie also lent their talents to the album.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">&#8220;Simple Man&#8221; was mixed by recording engineer Gary Paczosa, who has worked on six Grammy-winning projects, including Nickel Creek&#8217;s &#8220;This Side,&#8221; the Dixie Chicks&#8217; &#8220;Home&#8221; and Dolly Parton&#8217;s &#8220;The Grass is Blue.&#8221; Although his skills are of the behind-the-scenes variety, the highly sought Paczosa was near the top of the Chapman&#8217;s wish list when they began planning the album.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">The result is an album of stellar musicianship, haunting melodies, tight family harmonies and, most important, great songs. Choosing songs was no easy task given that the Chapmans began the process with some 3,200 songs at their feet. The final set they is anchored by songs like &#8220;Ode To A Simple Man&#8221; by Kim Fox, one of the band&#8217;s favorite songwriters. Originally written as a modern country song, the tale of hard working, everyday people becomes a powerful piece of Americana in the hands of the Chapmans. &#8220;Runaway Kind&#8221; exhibits the band&#8217;s ability to capture the rootsy, lonesome feeling that is the essence of bluegrass, yet it is also the song the Chapmans believe has the greatest potential for crossover into the country radio format. &#8220;The Photograph,&#8221; a lost-love ballad with a lyrical twist, is nothing short of haunting.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">With their work in the studio finished, the Chapmans are now on the road, giving their fans across the country a taste of these songs live. Averaging about 140 shows each year, the Chapmans keep a busy schedule that takes them to bluegrass festivals from Maine to Texas and even Europe.</font></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"></font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\">Now a group of seasoned performers with a well-respected recording career to their credit, the Chapmans are ready to go wherever the music takes them.

Neither genera completely fits the description of his music, but his lyrical imagery is both dark and heartfelt, while his rhythmical talent lies on the acoustic/rock side of the spectrum. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBorn in Rochester, NY, Samuel began to play music at an early age by banging pots and pans together in the kitchen and singing. At the age of 8 he started learning to play the Drums and had waited till the age of 16 to pick up the guitar and teach himself how to play. Both his parents encouraged him musically to find his own way. He favors a 12 string guitar named Amber, 6 string electric guitar named Raven, a set of hand drums, and a Keyboard to express himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt wasn&#39;t till the loss of his sister that he began writing. After that his lyrical design took on a life of it&#39;s own. Samuel made his music his release, and his therapy. As one fan put it &quot;There&#39;s something for everyone to relate to within his music...&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSamuel&#39;s music didn&#39;t start coming together till the fall of 1998 while living in Fargo, ND.

Her earliest musical influences are Motown, New Orleans Jazz &amp; Funk, Eastern Ethnic Music, and Old School NY Hip Hop. She started learning classical piano, dance, and singing in a church choir at a very young age, till at 15 she decided to pick up the guitar and has been playing ever since. Her early years of playing rock and blues with various garage bands slowly grew into a more specific and &quot;mature&quot; sound, and she teamed up with the duo Andy and Simon of Hyplar (les disques aquatic). As a vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and co-writer for Hyplar, Marie experimented with a fusion of what she describes as &quot;liquid electronic crooning music that makes you want to roller skate&quot;. Parallel to performing with Hyplar, Marie was working with another recording band called Indaba with musicians Black Moses and Simo, also as a vocalist, rhythm guitarist and co-writer. Before leaving Greece, Marie teamed up with a producer and worked with him as a co-writer for many Greek pop artists on some funky soul and r&amp;b music that today are hits. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince moving back to NYC, Marie has been working on completing the production of her solo album &quot;Melody of Love&quot;. Playing weekly shows throughout the city with her band and building a good following.. She was voted into the Top 10 in Myspace&#39;s Top Unsigned Artists for Neo-Soul for NYC, as well as featured artist and finalist in the &#39;Make My Music Video&#39; competition for BestOfBands.com. More recently, Miss Marie has been recording for a compilation album &quot;Rhythms of the Diaspora&quot;&nbsp; for which she collaborated with legendary artists such as LL Cool J, Gil Scott Heron, The Last Poets, Stanley Clarke, Sidney Mills, Larry McDonald, Trouble Funk, Swiss Chris (drums John Legend),&nbsp; and more to be relased Feb. &#39;08. Miss Marie also is an active volunteer and devotes time for charity work. She is involved with humanitarian organizations such as Musicians On Call (www.musiciansoncall.com) where she performs for patients at hopsitals around NYC, Greek Aid (www.greekaid.org) raising money for the victims of the fires which devastated Greece in Aug &#39;07, and other charity concerts and events.<br />\r\n</span></strong></font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial\"><font face=\"Arial\"></font></font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/missmarieband\"><font color=\"#7f9aba\">www.reverbnation.com/missmarieband</font></a> \r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/missmarieband\"><font color=\"#7f9aba\">www.youtube.com/missmarieband</font></a> (live shows)\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marienyc\"><font color=\"#7f9aba\">www.myspace.com/marienyc</font></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\nbooking: <a href=\"http://www.sonicbids.com/missmarie\"><font color=\"#7f9aba\">www.sonicbids.com/missmarie</font></a>&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\ncontact: <a href=\"mailto:miss_marie@musician.org\"><font color=\"#7f9aba\">miss_marie@musician.org</font></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"../forums/showthread.php?t=142\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt\">Interact with miss marie&#39;s fans</span></a>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(592,647,'Southern Mischief',1,16,'http://www.SouthernMischiefBand.com','3990 Woodland CIR SE - Conyers, GA 30013','678-768-4028','<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font color=\"#ff0000\"><strong><img src=\"../uploads/647/southern%20mischief%20band.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"486\" height=\"600\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nABOUT:</strong> </font><strong>SOUTHERN MISCHIEF</strong> <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormed in February 2007, Southern Mischief began with a simple statement of purpose: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>&quot;We are on a Mission to bring back the glory days of Southern Rock &amp; Roll.

However, when they are together doing what they do best their differences put them in tune with each other. When together any person can easily be swept up and taken to a different place. A total of five siblings, they were raised together by their mother alone. They had to move every couple of years while they were young, so making friends and adjusting to new circumstances and surroundings eventually came easy for them. During their adolescent years&rsquo; believing that there is a reason for everything was essential.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nChad, the lead guitarist and the eldest, probably grew up faster than any of them. Becoming the man of the house happened around the age of 10. His responsibilities consisted of keeping peace between the younger ones and just being there to watch over the family. Responsible and self-sufficient he left the family to go out on his own at an early age. He moved to Mississippi, married, and settled down with two sons. Chad&rsquo;s musical talent and interest has always been a part of who he is, so he found satisfaction playing with various small town bands while living in the south. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDustin, the lead vocalist, has been a natural entertainer since the day he picked up the guitar. When in company the guitar is always by his side. Very talented and very modest about his capabilities, his music comes from the heart. Determined to be his own man he also left the house in his late teens. Dustin settling down at an early age and taking his responsibility as a spouse and father very serious was not a surprise to anyone who knows him well. He knew as a preteen that he is family orientated and would one day have one of his own. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrett, the rhythm guitarist and the youngest, definitely drives this band. The absence of his siblings during his teen years left him alone with his thoughts and dreams. Brett stayed at home and finished school with goals of becoming a law enforcer, at the same time believing in the dream he has for himself and his family. His gift of awareness goes hand and hand with his understanding of life. Compassionate, soft spoken and extremely loyal Brett thrives on good times, family and friends.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter ten years Chad&rsquo;s marriage came to an abrupt and unexpected end. He moved back to Ohio to be with his family for moral support. Together these brothers found an outlet for expressing who they are through music. They connect with the listener by singing about real life. Chad&rsquo;s old school rock, Dustin&rsquo;s new age or alternative sound, and Brett&rsquo;s melody combined gives this band their unique sound. Their differences compliment each other in spirit and in talent. Their mothers&rsquo; determination and motivation to do her best set in play for them that with these two attributes anything is possible. To this day they believe that there is a reason for everything, and Brett&rsquo;s vision began to take place. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Poetic Reasoning.\r\n</p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"../forums/showthread.php?t=147\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt\">Interact with Poetic Reasoning&#39;s fans</span></a>\r\n',1,'Dustin Webb- Vocals<br />\r\nChad Terry- Lead Guitar<br />\r\nBrett Webb- Rhythm Guitar\r\n',0,''),(598,656,'Bru',10,45,'','','','<h4>A few of my friends told me \"write me a song... write me a song\",\r\nso i did just that.

Acts like Regurgitator, The Veronicas and Powderfinger have inspired a whole new wave of young talent who also aspire to become music legends. <br/><br/>Brisbane 5-piece 1989 are no exception. Formed in late 2006 by 22 year old singer Simon Vermeulen, 20 year old bassist Jason Fuller, and 18 year old guitarist Thomas Sheldrake, the band came together to launch their dream of making music that would touch people, and pull them back in time to the 1980&#8217;s. <br/><br/>The bands musical genre could best be described as an 80&#8217;s rock sound with modern sensibilities. Each member of the band has been strongly influenced by the distinctive sound of 80&#8217;s rock, and because of that influence they called their band 1989, as that year signified the end of 80&#8217;s rock. <br/><br/>The boys of 1989 are still living in that year&#8230; but thankfully their fashion sense and hair styles have moved on with the times! <br/><br/>While practicing and dreaming of getting a break into the music industry, the boys realised something was missing from their ensemble. As a three piece outfit they decided they needed a little extra rhythm and decided they would need to recruit a second guitarist. As the band&#8217;s vocalist, Simon, was pulling double duties by singing and drumming, they decided it might be a good idea to recruit a drummer also. That&#8217;s how Mark Haddon and Steve Tyssen came to join the band. <br/><br/>Mark was a 32 year old work colleague and friend of Simon, so he was the perfect choice for the band as his experience and talent on the guitar made him a certain shoe-in. <br/><br/>Finding 21 year old Steve was a little harder though. After many months of ads and auditions the boys started to think they were never going to find anyone talented enough to join their outfit. But, in the best mould of legendary bands everywhere, that&#8217;s when Steve answered an ad one day out of the blue. He blew them away and added that extra something to the mix. This is when the boys knew their search was over. <br/><br/>In late March 2007, the band 1989 was officially formed, and they jumped into rehearsing and writing new songs straight away. Since then they have self-recorded and produced their original debut 6-track EP completely out of the drummer&#8217;s shed. <br/><br/>1989 are just a group of ordinary boys with big dreams, but they actually have the talent necessary to make it, and the dedication required to sustain it. Rehearsing out of Tommy&#8217;s father&#8217;s garage (Tyrepower Redcliffe), they crank the sounds out as they perfect their chosen art and bring their dreams closer to reality. <br/><br/>Look out for the lads at a gig near you soon.

Well, I\'ll try to keep it short and concise.&nbsp;<br/>My name is Bj&oslash;rn Lid. I was born in a (very) small town in Norway on&nbsp;December 13th, 1976. And I still live in the same small town today. I\'m a singer, or that is; I sing, and wanna become a singer.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;written some songs, but I\'m definitely not a very productive song-writer. When it comes&nbsp;to&nbsp;taste&nbsp;in music,&nbsp;I like a lot of the old stuff; The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles.... Roy Orbison\'s voice brings tears to my eyes.<br/>I like groups such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Guns\'n Roses. But I also like a lot of the \"newer\" groups and singers; Travis, Oasis, R.E.M, Kula Shaker, U2, Lisa Marie Presley, Amy Whineheart is great. I like an amazing Norwegian group called Madrugada and an other Norwegian group called AHA. But NOTHING... compares to Elvis!!!&nbsp;<br/>I don\'t know how relevant hobbies and stuff like that are, but&nbsp;what the heck; I like to work out. I lift weights 3-5 times a week.<br/>I\'m interested in a lot that has to do with science, or in the grey-zone between science and science fiction. The supernatural and occult. I suck up anything I come across of books and&nbsp;movies about UFOs, The Bermuda Triangle, The Great Pyramids of Giza, ghosts and hauntings and so forth.&nbsp;I love animals, especially cats. I have three.&nbsp;<br/>In late August, I\'m entering a studio to start working on my first album/CD with my own material... my own songs. As soon as that album is ready to be released, I will promote it for all that it\\\'s worth. Both on my music MySpace site, my showcase and off course... here!!!<br/>I hope there\'s something here that you find worth listening to. I have a Live-Album/CD ready to be released in a couple of weeks.<br/>One Night At \"Cinderella\"-Benefit For Natalie (02. 03. 2007).&nbsp;It is a recording of a&nbsp;benefit I did, to raise money&nbsp;for a young girl named Natalie. Her father got shot and killed in Thailand, right before New Year 2006. We didn\'t have enough time to gather a full band and singers, and put together a show; so I had to use \"Sing-Back\". It didn\'t seem to matter to the audience though. They were absolutely fantastic!!! The show lasted almost three full hours. I\'ve added 12 tracks, just to give you an idea of how the CD will sound like. When it\'s ready, all 39 songs from the show will be on it. The&nbsp;CD&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;bought&nbsp;for&nbsp;179.50 NOK. That\'s about 32$. I hope you like some of the&nbsp;tracks I\'ve added&nbsp;so far!!! ENJOY:)<br/><br/>I can\'t think of anything more to add right now. I think&nbsp;that&nbsp;just about&nbsp;sums it all up.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to drop by, and check out my music. <br/><br/>LOL, Bj&oslash;rn<br/><br/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=202\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Bjorn Lid\'s fans</span></a>',0,'',0,''),(619,685,'Act Naturally',1,66,'www.myspace.com/actnaturallyrock','','','<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=153\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Act Naturally\'s fans</span></a><br/><br/>',1,'',0,''),(621,672,'aDORE',1,66,'www.myspace.com/adoreuk','','07732082363','aDORE are a creative five piece hailing from London and surrounding towns, who met through various mutual friends and musical collaborations.<br/><br/>aDORE have played a&nbsp;large number of successful shows in and around London (which are getting bigger, along with the venues)&nbsp;and are currently looking for management.&nbsp; They are also looking to perform in their respective home towns and other cities around the UK.<br/><br/>Their songs have a dark, emotional resonance and lyrics that find the beauty in pain.

Immediate, exciting and\r\nartistically confrontational, the music of Apathy is a post-modern\r\nexpression of humanity in the here and now. It&#8217;s also a helluva potent\r\nsource of entertainment. <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> Another Realm <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> Music may intersect with this world but it exists in a place all\r\nits own. It is, in fact, a place all its own. At least that&#8217;s what the\r\nmembers of Apathy will tell you. Its power is transcendent and its\r\nability to whisk the listener away to another place is proof enough of\r\nits status as a universe in its own right. &#8220;It&#8217;s another realm, and\r\nwhile we&#8217;re playing, we care about nothing else. Thus the name Apathy.&#8221;\r\nInterestingly enough, those who have heard Apathy say the same thing\r\nabout the band&#8217;s music &#8211; when Apathy is playing, the fan has no\r\nconcerns other than wallowing in the transportational exuberance of\r\nApathy. <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> Impact <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> &#8220;We try to make our songs very powerful,&#8221; says Clint VanSciver of\r\nApathy, who states that impact on the listener is a prime goal of this\r\nband&#8217;s songwriting. He says that lyrically the group offers a hint of\r\nambiguity mixed with relatively concrete ideas in order to give the\r\nlistener something with which to relate while allowing the audience to\r\nfind the specific meaning therein. Musically, it&#8217;s all about attitude.\r\n&#8220;There is an attitude about every Apathy song that makes it very\r\ncharismatic, just hooky enough to draw you in but gritty enough to get\r\nyou going.&#8221; <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> The Artist at Work <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> The song &#8220;Anything You Want&#8221; was played for three solid days on\r\nGeorgetown&#8217;s 93.5 The Beach during Chris Steele&#8217;s program. Apathy\'s\r\noriginals also nab regular airplay on Ocean City, Maryland&#8217;s X106.9. In\r\na little more than a year, the group has played almost 40 shows in a\r\nvariety of venues, with more gigs still to come. The Worcester County\r\nTimes gave the band front page press and Apathy has also appeared in\r\nthe Delaware Beachcomber, the Seaford Leader, the Morning Star, the\r\nDaily Times, the Dispatch/Maryland Coast Dispatch, the Sussex Post, the\r\nCape Gazette and the Delmarva Youth Magazine. The group is currently\r\nworking with A&R Select, the hottest indie A&R firm in\r\nHollywood, CA. &#8220;Apathy, as well as many who have experienced our music,\r\ntruly believe that we&#8217;re the next big thing.&#8221; And these musicians have\r\nthe work ethic to pay off for the label with the faith to offer them to\r\nthe world as that next great rock act. <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> Review <br/>\r\n\r\n<br/> &#8220;While Apathy certainly embraces elements of grunge rock, the\r\ngroup is NOT to be understood as dwelling in the past. If anything,\r\nthis band is carrying rock-n-roll into the future.&#8221; &#8211; A&R Select <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nQuotes about Apathy:\r\n\r\n\"[Apathy produces] strong rock tracks with a diverse array of sounds to\r\nbring to the table ranging from classic rock to indie rock to grunge.\"<br/>\r\n\"Apathy comes in with high energy and great drum grooves and in the pocket strength.\"<br/>\r\n\"The vocals are a good fit for the music.\"<br/>\r\n\"The band has a certain attitude about them which gives them more depth and energy all around.\"<br/>\r\n\"Well written songs\"<br/>\r\n\"Great acoustic and clean sounds.\"<br/>\r\n\"Great straight up rock band with good\r\nsongwriting.\"<br/>\r\n\"Catchy choruses and unique\r\nrock song writing.\"<br/>\r\n\"Great band for the genre.\"</font>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=207\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Apathy\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(663,755,'Maxim Sound',6,31,'','','','<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=304\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Maxim Sound\'s fans</span></a><br/>',1,'',0,''),(2405,1000144,'Human Vibe',1,68,'http://myspace.com/humanvibe','','514-966-7771','<span><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"></font></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: \'Times New Roman\'\"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Human Vibe is a combination of Nicko&rsquo;s soul-filled voice and music and the talent of professional musicians Luc on drums and Karine on bass.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Their lyrics and rock music are highlighted with several colourful styles such as funk, reggae and folk.<span>&nbsp; </span>The group&rsquo;s influences come from a wide variety of musical styles, from hard rock and alternative rock such as Tool and Alice in Chains, to British groups like The Police, Genesis and Yes.

All of the members have the goal of not being shy to explore any musical possibility. They display this with their use of a vintage Rhodes, tambourines, and distinct progressions on their latest EP. They have a &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s try this&#8230;&#8221; mindset, and are not content until each part has its own defining signature.<br/><br/>The band headed into Chicago\'s Gallery of Carpet studios with engineer/producer Brian Zieske (The Hush Sound, The Academy Is..., The Audition). They set out to create a record where each song had an individuality and distinct groove, yet still contributed to the overall feel. With both verses and choruses containing strong melody, their sound is captivating. The Hopeless Romantic EP was completed in early January 2007. After Never is using this to make their stamp in the swelling Chicago music scene.<br/><br/>After Never was founded in 2006 by Artie Woods (drums), Michael Murphy (bass), and Dennis Mitchell (guitar). The three friends wanted to accomplish their collective dream, to make music their life. The trio set out in search of a voice, B.J. Radigan was happy to fill that role with his unique, smooth style. Adam Cieslak (Mitchell\'s childhood friend and former band mate) then joined (guitar) to add further dynamic to the group.<br/><br/>The band has quickly landed shows with nationwide major label acts such as Kill Hannah (Atlantic) and the Pink Spiders (Geffen) and indie acts like Valencia (I Surrender Records) and Four Letter Lie (Victory). Armed with a rapidly growing fan base and catchy songs, After Never displays no signs of stopping soon. They have gained sponsorships from Random Clothing and C&C Drum Company. The members of After Never are on a mission to make their music heard, if you haven&#8217;t yet, they will make sure it&#8217;s only a matter of time. </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=172\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with After Never\'s fans</span></a><br/>',1,'',0,''),(717,834,'Everyone Must Win',1,66,'www.myspace.com/everyonemustwin','','','Everyone Must Win is the 11th commandment.

Amberdeen mix and experiment with both indie and punk genres. With comparisons to Anti-Flag, Hot Hot Heat and Kisschasy (killyourstereo.com), Amberdeen are different to anything else you&#8217;ve heard. By using both electric and acoustic guitars they have captured a sound that is truly unique. <br/><br/>Amberdeen began carving out a presence in the Sydney scene in 2006. Throughout the year Amberdeen played HOME Nightclub, The Lansdowne, The Attic, The Embassy Hotel plus youth festivals Enliven and Ignite. They supported Behind Crimson Eyes on their Shakedown Tour in October and also graced the stage with the likes of The Valley, Another Day Down, The Veld and Fingerprint Resistant. <br/><br/>In October Amberdeen independently recorded and distributed their debut EP titled &#8220;Not Forgotten Freedom&#8221;. The first track &#8220;Stay Where You Are&#8221; was instantly added to rotation of FBi 94.5 and graced the airwaves of Triple J, SWR, B Rock (Bathurst) and other community stations. The indie rock track was so infectious that it was chosen out of thousands by Sony reps as one of ten Sony BMG &#8216;Hottest Picks&#8217; in the currently running &#8216;Uncharted&#8217; Competition. <br/><br/>Amberdeen kicked off 2007, by going to Orange to play the Get Punked Festival. The reception of the all ages crowd was so fantastic that they returned in March for another all ages show. In between however they found the time to support Something With Numbers at the Embassy Hotel and begin work on a new release for late 2007.

Dissonant chord progressions half step their way to a blend between dark metal, punk, and Scorps-ish Zoo movements in the opening track, \"Shes a Little Different\". The entire recording, done in Apple\'s GarageBand program, is a testament to the tools of the day and the end result is an album that has the passion of metal with the alternative attitude of Nirvana. Vocals are hypnotically mixed back a bit - and the equalization is absent of high end which adds a darkness to the music. Track 3, \"Cousin Jed\", starts out with a distorted harmonica, and moves into the strongest rock groover on the record. The story goes \'let me tell you \'bout my cousin Jed, at a young age he was dropped on his head, it\'s all good when the family gets together. .Jed loves his truck. .he\'s the Marlboro Man, with a big brim cap and his Coors in his hand, that\'s my cousin Jed\'. Closer to the Real blends a hiphop delivery with pure metal that is a refreshing blend that takes us back to the walk this way days. Nice. In track 4, \"Snap Shots\", the band moves as one in musical passages that are tight and inventive. The tune pays respect to the snap shots we take in our heads won\'t forget. The final track, \"Let it End\", opens with a cymbal, that metallic bronze bass line perfection, and moaning meandering swelling guitars. The substantial metal groove of the guitars is compelling as the left/right tightness of their recording occasionally departs independently of the other into harmonies and spaces. The tune is about the end of a dead relationship - but we were hardly requesting the same of the sixth track on the CD as it is one of the more haunting and interesting tracks on the record. We look forward to more. </span><br/></div>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=182\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Closer To The Real\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(774,926,'A Dance With Jack Ketch',1,73,'www.myspace.com/dancewithjack','','','Started in the Fall of 2006 in Troy, Ohio, A Dance with Jack Ketch is comprised of five amazing musicians.

Faded Hope consists of four very committed young men who have made music their entire life. Their music is a part of their souls, a part of their essence, and very much a part of their existence. These four men, who range from the ages of 21 to 25, have given everything that they are and sacrificed everything they have to create a name for themselves. Fronted by a strong and raspy voice that gives depth to their material, Faded Hope?s heavy sound and deep lyrics pulls you into a musical euphoria that touches your very soul. They have a deep connection with their fans, and each of their supporters connects with their music in a way that is profound. It?s almost as if they are giving voice to your inner thoughts and feelings, and that is something that sets them apart from all the other bands out there. Faded Hope has incredible drive that will take them to the top of the music industry. Their do or die attitude and dedication to their craft is what will take them far, and whether they conquer their small little corner of Ohio, the entire state, or the entire nation they will do so by staying true to who they are and continuing their deep connection with their fans. To Faded Hope no matter where they go, they play with pride and respect, honoring who they are and where they came from. influences- staind,nickleback,pantera,trapt,closure Places played are: Peabody&#8217;s in Cleveland.

The band supported the album throughout the year playing gigs throughout Southern Illinois and some select shows near St. Louis, MO. In 2004, guitarist Shain Lloyd quit playing live to devote time to his family and newborn baby. Trevor followed in late 2005. Mike and Brad continued to play shows under the Junkvine name throughout the area with various line-ups.

With there influences of bands such as Motley Crue, Metallica, AC/DC, Gun&#8217;s and Rose&#8217;s and anything else from that great era of music, they created a rock sound that is hard to beat and easy to rock out to. Chris Moss, drums, was bought up playing jazz drums with his father and brings a phat rhythmic sound to the rhythm section of the band. Craig Vincent or &#8216;Vincent Fury&#8217; as we know him stepped onto lead guitar in Dec. 2006. Vincent Fury is the former Wretched Child guitarist and brings the quickest, most unbelievable shredding to be heard. Shane Finney was called up one Tuesday morning in Jan. 2007 and asked to audition for Dirty Diamonds and after just one song, the band knew that this was there man to take the front of the band. Shane, former Darkshot lead singer has a huge vocal range, melodic sound and the capability of writing anything from a lovesick ballad to a top of the charts rock song. Their first single, EMO was written by Shane in late 2006 and as soon as Shane heard the sound of Dirty Diamonds knew that the two would go together greatly. EMO is written for anyone that has ever felt like they had no one. Each verse tells a story and takes you through one young mans trip through the voices inside his head. Following in the steps of other great local S.E .Queensland bands such as Powderfinger, The butterfly Effect, Chasing Gravity(formerly Elephant Mojo) butterfingers, Japunga and many more, Dirty Diamonds will not stop until they have reached stardom and a top ten single on the Aria charts.

These fans are infected by the energy that Kennedy Road puts into every song whether it\'s on a CD, on the radio or at a show. Kennedy Road has been described many times over as \"...a 3 piece band that hits you with so much sound and energy, you would swear they\'re a 5 piece if you weren\'t looking.\" and that brings a smile to their faces. Originally formed in 2005 under the name Niteshift, Kennedy Road has performed many high profile shows and gained a great amount of exposure in the process. Kennedy Road has opened for such nationally touring bands as Drowning Pool, Ra and 10 Years. In the winter of 2006 Kennedy Road was chosen to perform in The Rave Bar (www.therave.com for more info) as a pre-show opener for the then current Sevendust tour. By doing this Kennedy Road has joined a long list of bands who have since gone on to do great things in the world of music. Most currently Kennedy Road has been building their fan base on the homefront. The Back Bar in Janesville, WI has been Kennedy Road\'s \"home\" for the better part of the last year (www.thebackbar.com for more info). Through their shows at The Back Bar, Kennedy Road was chosen to open for Caroline\'s Spine, a nationally touring band from Oklahoma (www.carolinespine.com for more info). This was a sold out show that exposed the Kennedy Road style to hundreds of people. Along with this, Kennedy Road is currently being filmed as one of the feature bands in a documentary about the rock music scene in Rock County, which is where the band originates from. This project is still in the early stages of filming and delopement, but the main goal for the future is to have this video shown and distributed across the country. Kennedy Road is very excited about this project and hopes that it will expose them to many people who normally would not get a chance to see them. What the future holds for Kennedy Road is anyone\'s guess. With a little help they hope to rock bigger venues, record a full length CD and tour with other amazing bands and artist\'s.

As the age of the great selfishness settles in we will fight to keep love alive and brotherhood. The Scarred Theory will be forever remembered for truth and love. We love what we do and each other. That is the key for our soon to come success. We will embrace those that discourage and champion those who believe. We are a metal band becuase the raw energy in metal music is an addiction and each one of feel it when we play it. We are different in the way that we dont view this as a hobby or click.

The band\'s music spans from rock to pop, blues to soul, and everywhere in between. There really are no limits to the kind of music they write. \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>Chris began playing music in elementary school but stopped for many years when he hit middle school. It was during his sophomore year at Southern Oregon University where things started to take shape. First he took a beginning piano class from a very talented Russian concert pianist. He then started singing with friends as a way to impress girls at parties. Unfortunately it never really took off. When Chris turned 21, he started singing in karaoke bars where he noticed people responded well to his singing. It was those experiences that led him to start pursuing the idea of a career in music. Less than a year later he picked up a guitar, and with nothing but a chord book and some tabs, taught himself how to play. The rest, as they say, is history... \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>The Band made it to the second round of the Bodog National Battle of the Bands contest in 2006 before they had to bow out because they lost their bass player. They have received airplay in Seattle on The End( 107.7) for their song \"Wonderful Nothing\". \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>Merrill is also receiving accolades on garageband.com: \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>The song Intervention received the Rocking Track in Pop Rock award, week of 25th of June, 2007. And the Song Back 4 More was selected as The Track Of The Day for July 28th, 2007. The song also has recieved two other awards; Feel Good Track in Pop Rock, week of 16th of July, 2007 and Rocking Track in Pop Rock, week of 2nd of July, 2007. \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>Though very ambitious in it\'s pursuits of touring, the group\'s roots are in Portland. Chris has worked professionally with several schools in different aspects, including: admissions, student development, academic counseling, and helping to promote education. He also formerly owned and operated Synergy Music, a media production company in Gresham. \r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div><br/>Merrill has written countless songs and is looking to record and release their debut album in 2007.

Martin and Peter had been playing together for a number of years and with Niklas they decided that the assistance of an additional guitar player/singer would be required to make the day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Enter Jens Westin, guitar player and singer extraordinaire and the brew began to simmer. <br/>After a couple of jam sessions the pieces of the jigsaw started to show a picture, it was dark, it was heavy, it was angry and it looked good.&nbsp;<br/></span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: If;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">A</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">fter writing a couple of more songs it was clear that the path of the band would be in the heritage of the heavy rock acts of the 70s with additional layers of a more modern sound.

She&rsquo;s one of those open and honest people who wear their hearts firmly on their sleeves in the name of their art. Her incredible debut album &lsquo;85th and Nowhere&rsquo; had not only her homeland of America enraptured, it also caused genuine excitement throughout Europe. Respected music reviewers from revered music publications had nothing but genuine praise for her debut effort. The Swedish music press described her work as &lsquo;a confident collection of songs musically reminiscent of Nick Lowe&#39;s early 80&rsquo;s sound&rsquo;. In Scotland the press mused that she &lsquo;has a capability to evoke countless emotions&rsquo; and &lsquo;an intensity of unquestionable depth&rsquo;. The career dictating London journos were impressed enough to write &lsquo;sounding like Deborah Harry did when she was at her best in the 80&rsquo;s&rsquo;. &#39;85th and Nowhere&#39; also drew this comment courtesy of the &#39;Manila Standard&#39; in the Philippines: &lsquo;probably one of the most important artists that you have not heard yet&rsquo;. These quotes, and so many others, are genuine snippets from reviews by people who have been in the business long enough to separate the wheat from the chaff. Should further evidence of Michele Ari&rsquo;s talent be needed then surely an invite to perform at London&rsquo;s International Film and Poetry Festival alongside Patti Smith, or, &lsquo;1,000 Kisses&rsquo; being named song of the year by a WMNF dj or even, the inclusion of her songs on American and European radio play lists is enough to convince anyone of her worth. Michele is a catalyst for these times. Her voice is no fluke, her talent is as natural as breathing, and her grasp of song writing is uncanny. She remains a much needed transfusion of new blood for the veins of a genre quickly running out of ideas and direction. Half the world is unaware of her existence and the other half is unable to keep the secret! Expect many &lsquo;I discovered her first&rsquo; claims when she finally strolls onto the map that will place her alongside many other luminaries of this fickle industry. Don&rsquo;t take the word of the press, or the actions of a country, find out for yourself and be privy to the worst kept secret , but the best bet for success, this music industry currently has to offer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"../forums/showthread.php?t=267\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt\">Interact with Michele Ari&#39;s fans</span></a> \r\n',0,'',0,''),(1132,407,'Tracee Noelle',9,43,'http://www.myspace.com/traceenoelle','','310 728 9956','<p>\r\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh faced optimism that drew R&amp;B singer Tracee Noelle to LA&rsquo;s music scene belies the dark tales of loss and disillusionment driving her music.

Mindefect&rsquo;s music dodges easy genre classification, but that&rsquo;s OK &ndash; it&rsquo;s the sign of originality and creativity. The group soaks up influences from a diverse array of sources and therein lies part of the appeal of Mindefect&rsquo;s music. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too heavy to be rock but not heavy enough to be considered today&rsquo;s metal.&rdquo; The band&rsquo;s style reaches across years of rock-n-roll territory, culling ideas from classic flavors, contemporary sounds and much of what is in-between. It&rsquo;s a rich offering of aural excitement contained in a Mindefect performance. Not content to follow the yellow line down the middle of the road, these musicians have headed off the turnpike everyone else is driving, carving their own path, marking the way for tomorrow&rsquo;s hard rockers. &ldquo;Mindefect is everything from the arena to the garage, aggressive to progressive, funky and dirty bluesy, sleazy, sensual and emotional (but not emo), trashy and refined, energetic and jaded with hooks, headaches, harmonies, hairpin turns, hammering rhythm and, most importantly, soul without pretense.&rdquo; No posing allowed; thus read the signs you see as you head into Mindefect&rsquo;s strip of the musical world. <br />\r\nPurpose<br />\r\nMusic&rsquo;s fun. Hell, yeah! It&rsquo;s party. It&rsquo;s passing the time. It&rsquo;s catharsis. It&rsquo;s great for driving. Music is many things. But ultimately, it&rsquo;s a direction, a focus for one&rsquo;s being. It applies to the die-hard music fan as well as the devoted ones who make the music for the die-hard fans. And it&rsquo;s no secret that the musicmakers are fans of the stuff themselves. Why else go into the business. (Unless it&rsquo;s just for business, in which case, the whole point has been missed and the quality will suffer. Not so Mindefect &hellip;) &ldquo;Music makes us feel alive. It gives us purpose.&rdquo; And part of finding purpose is finding identity, marking off one&rsquo;s place in the world and defending one&rsquo;s individuality. That is vital for listener and artist alike. &ldquo;Music keeps us from becoming another number in the huddled masses that works just to come home and zone out in front of the TV.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s a funny thing. Because looking inside, finding that purpose &hellip; that&rsquo;s also the place you look to find the source of music, the source of purpose. It&rsquo;s a circle spinning always, alive, breathing, thriving. Music hits its pinnacle when it&rsquo;s a labor of love pulled out from within &ndash; not surface varnish, not music for money without art. &ldquo;Let the music write itself. Don&rsquo;t try too hard with an idea. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than music that feels or sounds forced.&rdquo; The only force here, in the realm of Mindefect, is the music itself. And it is a force to be reckoned with. <br />\r\nThe Artist at Work<br />\r\nMindefect has seen two songs tapped for broadcast on 92.7 WLSR The Laser in Illinois. The band&rsquo;s first CD &ndash; &ldquo;Build Up to the Breakdown&rdquo; &ndash; is nearing completion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just waiting for the final mix so we can send it off to get it pressed.&rdquo; From therein, it&rsquo;s gigging. Anytime, anywhere.

These tours were funded by the Israeli Foreign Ministry who have chosen missFlag to represent Israeli culture and its ability to produce cutting edge western music.

That band is TOP JOHNNY! \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nIt is no secret that people in the music industry are infatuated with labels. They want to neatly classify different types of music, putting all of it in little organized folders somewhere on a musical shelf. TOP JOHNNY!, however, is a band that would drive all of these label-crazed people up the wall. They are quickly developing a reputation as one of Montreal&#39;s most interesting acts by offering something new and innovative to audiences who are accustomed to the sometimes formulaic brand of today&#39;s rock. They are an all-original, high-intensity party band whose sound is forged from a blend of searing rock guitar riffs, catchy vocal hooks, and pile-driving dance beats. \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nSounding as though KISS, C&amp;C Music Factory, Metallica, and Public Enemy befriended each other, TOP JOHNNY! is fronted by the magnetic TJ Star. The always intriguing singer claims that his concept of the band formed several years ago: &quot;I was always blown away by the energy and detail that bands like KISS put into their show. I guess TOP JOHNNY! became our way of doing more and giving more than most bands think is necessary.&quot; The band is receiving rave reviews for their immense wall of sound, which features TJ Star&#39;s powerful vocals and lead guitar, hard rockin&rsquo; bassist KARO, drummer Marc holding down a solid rhythm section while virtuoso guitarist Adam Pietrykowski adds yet another layer to the band&#39;s monumental soundscape. . \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nTOP JOHNNY! want to be defined by their live shows. Theirs is a live performance which epitomizes energy and unpredictability with TJ Star regularly going out into the crowd to play his wailing lead guitar solos so he can get up close and personal with his fans. He and the band are fully committed to connecting with their audience: &quot;I am not in this business to show people what a clever boy I am, but to connect with our audience...hopefully with millions of people worldwide!&quot; \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nIn an industry laced with deviant and degrading images and ideas, TOP JOHNNY! want to prove that rock n&#39; roll can be &quot;edgy and fresh without having to use profanity or crooked sexuality to get our point across&rdquo;. Already offering a live show and sound that is totally unique, this attitude further distinguishes TOP JOHNNY! from the rest of the crowd. \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nTOP JOHNNY! share a common vision for what they are doing. They all believe in a strong code of business ethics, and the band actively supports ecological values. The band gives 10% of all their concert and CD sales to the Planet Alert! Foundation, a non-profit organization formed to fund globally recognized projects which have the best chance of achieving lasting solutions to our planet&#39;s ecological and humanitarian problems. Front man TJ Star&#39;s desire to positively impact people stems from his initial encounter with rock music. Upon hearing KISS for the first time, he realized that &quot;the band gave me something to hope for, something to look forward to. It kept me out of trouble and in the end gave me a ton of self-confidence. I hope one day my music will also inspire a young person to pick up a guitar instead of a gun.&quot; \r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt\">\r\nCoupled with the band&#39;s highly energized music, striking costumes, and creative choreography, this willingness to make a difference is further proof that TOP JOHNNY!

Between the collaborations and the material Jon writes on his own, this daunting task has often left great songs in the closet. Hence, \"Jon Oliva\'s Pain\"! The Mountain King has been stockpiling songs for many a Savatage record and some of those songs, while not appropriate for the record at hand, were destined none the less to be brought to life. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the break between a new Savatage recording and the current 2003 TSO tour, Jon finally had the time to pursue the goal of bringing some of those songs to life. It was clear to him from the beginning that these songs were going to be a departure from the style and sound of the Sava-records of the past, and that was truly the point. <br/>Jon took his ideas into Audio-Lab recording studios in Tampa, Florida. With the help and expertise of engineer Greg Marchak, Jon began the process of recording the first seven songs to be featured on his solo release. He recorded every instrument on these demos, with the exception of the lead guitar solos, which were laid down by Matt LaPorte. The result was a compilation of songs that has been described as a cross between John Lennon and \"old school\" Savatage. Considering the fact that Jon is a HUGE Beatles fan, that comparison is a compliment to say the least. The music is bluesy, rich and full of the aggression that only Jon Oliva can deliver. The result was a great start to a potential solo release that Jon has wanted to do for a very long time.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Criss Oliva Memorial Concert was quickly approaching. Thoughts and memories of Criss are clearly evident throughout this collection of great new songs, and it was only fitting that they be debuted at Criss\' benefit concert. Fans would attend this anniversary event from Japan, Greece, Germany, Holland, Norway and a host of other countries, as well as from across the US. All would be there to pay tribute to Criss\' legacy and the music that he created with Jon and the members of Savatage both past and present. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Circle II Circle was already scheduled to perform, Jon quickly seized the opportunity to recruit these seasoned musicians to join him on stage to deliver this new sound and his new songs. Joining Jon on stage that night were Matt LaPorte (guitar), John Zahner (keyboards), Jason Jennings (bass), and Christopher Kinder (drums). The set would consist of 6 songs from Jon\'s solo catalog plus \"In the Dream\" from Power of the Night, \"Hey Bull Dog\" by the Beatles and a classic cover of \"Wishing Well\" by the band Free. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Memorial concert was a once in a lifetime event. Everyone in attendance (almost 1000 fans) piled into The Masquerade and prepared themselves for this historic tribute to one of the greatest guitar players of our time. An incredible show in which no words would adequately describe the energy level, would take Savatage fans on a \"walk down memory lane\" and become one for the history books...never to be repeated again. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jon and the band took to the stage following the performance of Circle II Circle. You could feel the energy in the air and the excitement of the audience to hear something new. They would not be disappointed. The band performed as if they had been playing together for years, and frankly most of them had. Matt and Chris have been playing together for nearly 10 years and were friends with both John Zahner and Jason Jennings. The relaxed, yet aggressive, mood on stage translated Jon\'s new material perfectly to the hungry ears below. Everything went as planned and now it was time to focus on what to do with this music and its future. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the memorial show, the band members parted ways with Circle II Circle. Realizing that he had a ready-made band, Jon quickly moved in on the opportunity to bring his solo material to the masses. The band embraced the opportunity without hesitation, and brought in former Circle II Circle bass player Kevin Rothney, to solidify the line-up. Rehearsals began immediately and within 4 short weeks \'Tage Mahal was hitting the stage in the Tampa, Florida area. The set included Jon\'s solo material and more than an hour of classic Savatage, some of which had not been performed live on stage in a very long time. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jon\'s voice has once again emerged as one of the most original and powerful voices in rock music. Response from the fans has been nothing short of exciting and the band continues to play with determined intensity. Delivering the new material as well as the old, has to be done properly and judging by the response, they\'ve done just that! <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our newest addition to the band is Shane French, through the 90\'s he played with Teer which gained him a large fan base both locally and overseas. In early 2003 He was approached by our own Matt LaPorte to join the Zak Stevens-fronted Circle II Circle. After the bands breakup we asked him to join his old bandmates to complete Jon Oliva\'s Pain. He is also currently working with Teer to release a new cd. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The future of Jon Oliva has taken on a new and profound direction. His ability to write one great song after another present boundless opportunities. Whether it is Jon Oliva\'s Pain, Savatage, TSO, or any other form, Jon\'s music will continue to flow from him... to all of you!\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=296\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Jon Oliva\'s Pain\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(1195,1388,'Memory Fade',1,14,'','','','Memory Fade picks up the pieces from a genre of music where emotion is expressed through aggressiveness, and oftentimes musicianship takes the back seat to the mainstream.

Coming from a small town in Georgia known better for its UFO sightings than for its music scene, it\'s natural for their songs to exude an escapist quality. Zeke Sayer&#8217;s light vocals lift away from simple acoustic strums with an eerie haze, bringing to mind the likes of Elliott Smith or Iron & Wine. Poppier tracks cleverly build catchy melodies in the vein of The Beatles and Snow Patrol. Their latest release displays new experimentation that shows, despite its retro sound, that this is the kind of band that can only move forward. <br/><br/><br/>The band began after vocalist/guitarist Zeke Sayer left his high school. &#8220;I did a lot of things that made me wide up in trouble, and one of those situations caused me to leave school,&#8221; he admits. &#8221;But I believe that everything happens for a reason, and while I was in school, I had no direction in life. It took losing something for me to have a wake up call and realize I\'d better do something with my life. So I started the band.&#8221; <br/><br/><br/>Sayer found his passion not only in playing the music, but in production. After finding the right line-up, he produced the band&#8217;s debut \"Conversations With Eyes Closed\" album in a renovated mobile home. Some of the music from this album has even appeared on the soundtrack for indie film The Philosopher. <br/><br/><br/>In 2007, Fact Not Fiction began recording their second album, A Corporate Calling, with Jon Bryant on guitar, Justin Vickery on bass, and Adam Grant on drums. Unfortunately, time constraints led Vickery to leave the band before the album was finished, and Tyler Glenn took over for the rest of recording. The album leaves behind the more somber and somnambulant mood of their first, with the rockabilly-esque &#8220;Powder Bag&#8221; to saccharine love tale &#8220;The Ballad of Jack and Amy.&#8221; Before the album&#8217;s official release, &#8220;Electric City,&#8221; was already chosen to be the official city song of Anderson, SC.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to playing shows from rural Hartwell, GA to indie oasis Athens, GA to a festival in front of hundreds in Anderson, SC, Fact Not Fiction has assembled a solid online fan base.

Another local musician took an interest in\r\nthe band and took their extensive catalog of original songs to his old\r\nfriend, Malcolm Springer. Malcolm happened to be one of the most\r\ntalented rock producers on the planet. Springer\'s credits are quite\r\nimpressive having engineered and produced countless major acts such as:\r\nMatchbox Twenty, Collective Soul, Fear Factory, Faith Hill, and the\r\nmultiplatinum Spiderman Soundtrack. Malcolm was also single-handedly\r\nresponsible for discovering, producing, co-writing with two very\r\nsuccessful bands: Full Devil Jacket, and the Grammy-nominated\r\nGreenwheel.<br/><br/>After an impromptu live tryout, Malcolm was quickly\r\nimpressed with the band\'s songwriting, work ethic, and potential.\r\nPromise to Burn immediately began pre-production with Springer within\r\ntwo weeks of the tryout in early 2006. By the end of April, the songs\r\nwere mixed at SoundStage Studios in Nashville. The debut EP, And\r\nEverything After, was released two months later.<br/><br/>After the\r\nrelease of the EP, Promise to Burn quickly developed a huge online\r\nfollowing while becoming a regional favorite in the Midwest through\r\ntheir live performances. The group has experience performing in\r\ncountless regional shows as well as headlining the world-famous Viper\r\nRoom and the Plush Lounge in Los Angeles, as well as headlining 12th\r\n& Porter in Nashville. The group has gathered various media\r\nattention in the Midwest by regional newspapers, radio stations, and\r\ntelevision news programs. The group has also warranted national\r\nattention when they had a rehearsal and interview filmed for Fox\'s\r\nAmerican Idol program in 2006 after lead singer, Heath Hartwell, made\r\nit to the late rounds in his first attempt to be the next American Idol.<br/><br/>In\r\nthe last few months, Promise to Burn has been playing a variety of\r\nregional shows where they played mix several well-known cover songs\r\nwith their growing collection of originals. To spice up their live\r\nperformances, Promise to Burn went to an extreme measure: they decided\r\nto let their alter-egos, an 80\'s glam metal group called Blind Lion,\r\nperform at many of their shows. Claiming to be the comeback of a hair\r\nband that dates back to 1983 (who composed every successful rock hit of\r\nthe 1980\'s), Blind Lion\'s delusions are a bit far-fetched. However\r\nthose delusions combined with the 1980\'s hair, attitudes, attire, and\r\npersona\'s transform a normal modern rock concert into a high-energy,\r\nunforgettable party that is guaranteed to entertain.</span>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=323\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Promise to Burn\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(2199,2357,'Balck Powder Revival',1,105,'reverbnation/blackpowderrevival.com','1913 n Banks','806-440-2273','Formed in may 2007.

Guitarist Ethan Yates is 17 and attends Douglass High School. --------------------- Nautical Twilight started playing music together in 2003. Throughout childhood, Doug would often visit his grandparents in Douglass, Texas where he there met the Yates brothers. Little did they know that Doug would later move to the area and the four would begin spending time together. All four members were competitive runners and began training together. The time spent together led them to find their common interest in music. Since then, the band has written original songs and also became versatile by playing for a wide variety of audiences ranging from Sunday Morning Worship Services to Rock Concerts at Youth Lock-Ins and Coffee Houses in numerous places. ---------------------------------- &quot;What is Nautical Twilight?&quot; The name comes from a meteorological term that describes a time when visibility is very bad. When a ship is sailing on the ocean and the sun is almost completely set but not quite. The sailors can&#39;t see anything around them. The horizon becomes invisible and the navigational stars are only beginning to come out. ----------------- This name was chosen because there are times in life when direction is hard to find and it is easy to feel abandoned and desperate. But the Lord has said that He will never leave us. All throughout the Bible and in our own lives we can see that the Lord has given us His promises and that He is always faithful to keep them. Faith is being sure of what we hope for in the evidence of what we don&#39;t see(Hebrews 11:1). Faith comes from hearing the Lord&#39;s word(Romans 10:17). Even in the times we can&#39;t see, we know that the Lord&#39;s word is real.

Emma\r\nNorling on bass and Jenny Forsberg on drums. The young Victoria Holden\r\n(fourteen going on fifteen) joined the band soon after and Ninja Dolls\r\nhad now a voice. Jonas Asplind played the guitar while they were\r\nlooking for a girl guitarist, no girl guitarist was found and Jonas was\r\nasked to join the band on permanent bases. Jenny F lost interest and\r\nwas replaced by another Jenny, Jenny Juhlin. <br/><br/>\r\nBy now Ninja Dolls were in full swing with a bunch of own produced\r\nmaterials.

Ninja Dolls did now a string of live performances in and\r\naround their hometown Falun in Sweden. After all this time with a bunch\r\nof people on second guitar, they felt that they needed to add a\r\npermanent guitarist. Martin Djuse became a member in Ninja Dolls in the\r\nautumn of 2002. In March 2003 Jenny left the band and now followed a\r\ntime of various stand in drummers until May the same year when Sara\r\nKlingstedt picked up the drumsticks. In October 2003 Ninja Dolls went\r\nin to the studio and recorded their first full length CD Drive In and\r\nin December a music video was made. Unfortunately Sara left the band in\r\nthe beginning of 2004, and once again Ninja Dolls was one member short.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBut in April they found their savior, Gustav Bergkvist who started to\r\nplay with the Ninjas.

Certainly Rhen would make no such\r\nassertion. Rhen realizes the struggles that confront people every day\r\nand writes music to provide an outlet, the creation of a perfect place\r\nthrough song in which people can find a temporary home, an escape from\r\ntension. \"There are times in life that we must do things that we don\'t\r\nwant to be doing and our minds wander off to dream of what we would\r\nlove to be doing instead.

Rhen has done this for himself and his\r\ncompelling music brings the gift of this ability to his listeners\r\nthrough music\'s distinct mode of inspiration. \"Mostly I am inspired by\r\nseeing others fight for their passion, be it an athlete, writer, or\r\nmountain climber, the struggle to reach beyond one\'s own limitations\r\nand share that experience.\" Self-empowerment emanates from every song\r\noffered the public by songwriter Adrian Rhen.<br/><br/>Always on My Mind<br/><br/>Rhen\'s\r\nforthcoming release, Always on My Mind, will be an emotive display of\r\nthis artist\'s power. A tour promoting the new album will send Rhen to\r\nthe East Coast this spring and summer, with trips to the West Coast and\r\nArgentina following in autumn. Rhen\'s musical muse strikes at\r\nunexpected moments and results in refreshing and surprising songs. \"I\r\nhave always tended to be very impulsive with my writing. I\'ll see a\r\nmovie that blew me away and I need to write a song. Then that idea will\r\nbe introduced to the band in that raw form and worked on and perhaps\r\neven performed in order to give it proper breathing space until it\r\neventually becomes the final version song that everyone will hear on\r\nthe album.\" Recording is an equally galvanizing experience, says Rhen.\r\n\"The recording process is both exciting and nerve-racking at the same\r\ntime. You\'re trying to revel in the fact that you have the privilege of\r\nrecording this moment in time of your life and also there is this voice\r\nin your head saying \'What if this doesn\'t turn out right?\' and \'What if\r\nI can\'t shape this into what I hear in my head?\' But once you realize\r\nthat these questions are asked by even the most respected artists, you\r\nstart enjoying the whole recording experience a whole lot more.\" Rhen\r\nis currently working with A&R Select, the leading indie A&R\r\nfirm in Hollywood, CA.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>\"Rhen\'s accomplished mix of pop rock with Spanish-language infusions is remarkable.\" - A&R Select<br/><br/><br/></span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"epksubheading\">Discography<br/></span>\r\n<span class=\"epktxt\">Always on My Mind (2007)<br/>Runaround (2005)<br/><br/>Streaming & radio airplay:<br/>\"Home\"<br/>\"Luz\"<br/><br/><br/></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span class=\"epksubheading\">Links<br/></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rhen\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myspace.com/rhen</a>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=355\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Rhen\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',0,'',0,''),(1378,1715,'Justus Prevails',1,71,'','','','This duo spans the gap of two generations, Keith being the old guy along side his younger counterpart, Ray.

Even before they cemented their line-up, Bryan and Chris had already gained the attention of producers, agents, managers etc. People seemed drawn to Chris\' stylistic, energetic stage presence and vocal ability and Bryan\'s songwriting skills that appealed to listeners of all kinds. The attention they received landed them in a studio in Tampa, FL to record their first CD titled \"Rockstar Weekend\". This CD was well received and helped Boxkar to hook up many great shows in the midwest. </p>\r\n<p>They rode this momentum into their second album, which was self titled. Coming out of an area that was known mainly for cover music, Boxkar was standing out with their originals. As for their live shows, Chris Szebeni was turning Boxkar gigs into a true event that audiences couldn\'t get enough of. A true front-man, entertainer and well trained vocalist, Chris was bringing back a vibe to the live music scene that\'s been missing for quite some time. In the summer of 2006, Boxkar grabbed themselves two WAMI(Wisconsin Area Music Industry) awards. The \"Male Vocalist of the Year\" went to Chris, and Boxkar was named \"Best Band in 2006\". Because of this growing attention, Boxkar nailed down some of their best gigs up to that point. They were now picking up shows headlining well known festivals around the midwest, including the Harley Rally and Summerfest. They also played the infamous Viper Room in LA and caught the attention of many people on the west coast. In January of 2005, Boxkar was invited to play the Presidential Inauguration in Washington, DC. They were on the bill for \"The Future Rocks Today\" concert, held at the DC Armory with artists such as Fuel, Ryan Cabrera, Ruben Studdard, Hillary Duff and Three Doors Down. This achievement caught the attention of Geoff Barton(Chief Editor) from Classic Rock Magazine out of London, England. Mr. Barton personally reviewed the CD in the Magazine and gave it incredible marks. He personally contacted the band and did a full page spread in the 2006 March issue. </p>\r\n<p>This leads us into the third and most recent CD, \"Comin\' out Swingin,\" which was eagerly reviewed in the 2007 January issue of Classic Rock Magazine by Mr. Barton, who rated this album near the top of his scale. Also, this CD took home the WAMI award for \"Album of the Year\" in 2007. This was a great accomplishment since Boxkar was going up against several great bands, including Skillet, which is a band that was nominated for a GRAMMY in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Boxkar\'s success has pleased many, but they are not finished yet. Chris and Bryan, along with fellow bandmates Matt Hammen on bass,&nbsp;Brian Saunders&nbsp;on lead guitar and Matt Gieseke on drums are in it for the long haul.

His first paying gig was at a biker bar in Watertown NY (then known as Jammer\'s Tavern) with half-brother Robin Davis where he played keyboards, guitar, lead vocals, and wrote original music for the popular upstate NY group \"Wirlwind\". During this period, he turned down an audition in NYC as a guitarist with the king of the twist \"Chubby Checker\". He later joined up with the 8-piece horn band \"Contraband\" and toured Florida with the group in the late 1970\'s. <br/><br/>While with \"Wirlwind\" and \"Contraband\" he shared the stage with such other acts as \"Blue Oyster Cult\", \"Chubby Checker\", \"Benny Mardones\", and \"Leslie West\" of \"Mountain\". \"Contraband\" returned to upstate NY in 1981 where the group disbanded, and a new \"Wirlwind\" band was formed. Wirwind disbanded in 1989. <br/><br/>Marc became interested in electronic music composition as a hobby. He later teamed up with Bob Watts to form \"Chauvette and Watts\" who would later become a staple in resort entertainment in the Thousand Islands in upstate NY. It was there that he would first meet \"The Scintas\", who were already legends in the Alex Bay region. At this time, Frankie Scinta told Chauvette \"If we ever make it big in this business, we\'re going to give you a call\". Marc was flattered but thought nothing would ever become of that. Chauvette was asked to join up with \"The Scintas\" in Las Vegas, Nevada in December of 2000 where he currently resides.<br/><br/><font style=\"font-family: Tahoma;\" face=\"Times New Roman\">In March of 2005, Chauvette caught up with Michael Mustizer, an aspiring film director/producer from the East coast. Chauvette, hoping to land a movie composing/scoring deal, agreed to score the music for a full-length action/ adventure feature called \"The Coldest Winter.\" He spent an entire year with trial and error mixes and re-writes. Finally in January of 2006, the film was released to be viewed at several indie film festivals and would pick up the Hollywood DV Film Festival\'s \"Best Action/Adventure Feature Film\" award, and the Fargo Fantastic Film Festival\'s \"Best Action/Adventure Feature Film\" award as well. The movie is currently under consideration for distribution. Also in the works in 2007 are tracks for the HARPO Sounds Catalog in Chicago. Chauvette\'s instrumental composition \"Osia Con Intensita\" was added recently to the catalog for future production considerations. Chauvette is currently in his own studio composing works for his new project \"702,\" a \"power-pop\" compilation of songs with ideas from a journal kept about moving from a small-town suburb to \"Sin City\".</font></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=407\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Chauvette\'s fans</span></a><br/>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(2169,2315,'Alberto Daglio',10,45,'','','','',1,'',0,''),(1454,1810,'A Cadence Paradigm',1,74,'freewebs.com/acadenceparadigm','','803 665 3008','<font color=\"#000080\" size=\"4\">A Cadence Paradigm, or ACP, is an up-and-coming band from Columbia, South Carolina with an original sound and a dedication to changing people\'s lives through their music.

Yes, that\'s right. I was about 10 years old and I had myself a little elementary school boyfriend who was taking trumpet lessons. So I decided I would take them too. Sadly for him, I got good really fast and he just kind of stayed bad. So I started playing the trumpet in band. Then I asked my dad for a guitar for my birthday when I was 11, he got me one, and the first song I ever learned was \"Hotel California\" (which my dad taught me). My family was a huge influence on my love for music. My sister who has always been good at finding awesome music taught me everything I know about alternative music. The first tape I remember buying was Nirvana \"Nevermind.\" Anyway, so by age 12, I had come to love everything from Sublime, to Shawn Colvin, to The Eagles. I realized I could sing around 13 when moving to a new state not only spurred new emotions but talents as well in writing. I started writing poetry and fell in love with free form. One day in the shower I think I started humming a tune and turned a poem into a song. Everything pretty much evolved from that moment when I fell even more in love with song writing.<br/><br/>Lullaby Appetite consists of 11 songs that display a unique of blend of music from jazz, rock and folk influences.&nbsp; Penned and performed by Alexa herself, these songs represent her own personal journey through life, love, acceptance, and lessons learned. Her fresh, smooth vocals slide easily around the extremely memorable melodies, toe-tapping rhythms and sprite guitar playing.&nbsp; The lyrics are rich with expression, exposing a vulnerability and honesty without na&iuml;vete.&nbsp; Rather there is an emotional maturity of looking at life with an optimistic eye, accepting one&#8217;s mistakes, and moving on.&nbsp; <br/><br/>From the jazz inspired &#8220;Sad Eyed Annabelle, to the upbeat and edgy &#8220;Good Fight,&#8221; Alexa&#8217;s songs center around love and relationships, something which everyone can relate to.&nbsp; In &#8220;Sad Eyed Annabelle,&#8221; Alexa portrays an unhealthy relationship where the girl is manipulating the boy whereas &#8220;Good Fight&#8221; reveals Wilkinson&#8217;s more playful side, such as picking a fight in a relationship. Fan favorite and Alexa&#8217;s first single, &#8220;Of Graves&#8221; depicts a young woman reminiscing about a past lover, while &#8220;Lullaby Appetite&#8221; talks about a long-distance friendship.<br/><br/>Half of the songs on &#8220;Lullaby Appetite&#8221; were produced and co-written by singer-songwriter Josh Kelley.&nbsp; So naturally, Kelley would have Wilkinson along on tour with him.&nbsp; Alexa opened for Josh in 10 cities across the US, from April 10th through May 4th, 2007.&nbsp; Being a fan of Alexa himself, Kelley stated &#8220;I was immediately impressed with Alexa&#8217;s music&#8212;she is an extremely talented singer and songwriter whose unique sound will no doubt propel her to the top.&nbsp; She&#8217;s got such a natural, easygoing style to her music that anyone from all ages can relate to it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m proud to have her on tour with me.&#8221;<br/><br/>www.myspace.com/alexawilkinson<br/>www.alexawilkinson.com<br/><br/><br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestofbands.com/forums/showthread.php?t=413\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Interact with Alexa Wilkinson\'s fans</span></a>',1,'',0,''),(1499,1878,'Kate Voegele',1,61,'www.katevoegele.com','','','<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: \'Times New Roman\'\">The musical landscape is teeming with singer/songwriters, many of them quite capable, but only a handful have something truly distinctive to offer. Kate Voegele belongs in the latter category. Don&#8217;t Look Away, Voegele&#8217;s first full-length album (MySpace Records), is a revelation, as the 20-year-old writer/singer, belying her tender years, delivers songs of depth and insight with a powerfully seductive voice that maintains a fierce presence amid dynamic rock grooves and infectious pop hooks. Produced by the veteran Marshall Altman (Matt Nathanson, Mark Broussard), Don&#8217;t Look Away is a bravura effort from an old soul with a youthful spirit; think of her album as a female parallel to John Mayer&#8217;s Room for Squares&#8212;at once a zeitgeist-capturing landmark and the launchpad for a viable career.<br/><br/>The tracks range from the rootsy acoustic ballad &#8220;Wish You Were,&#8221; with its mandolin and accordion filigree, and the sparse, piano-based &#8220;Kindly Unspoken&#8221; to the widescreen heartbreak anthem &#8220;Only Fooling Myself&#8221; and the ironically titled &#8220;It&#8217;s Only Life,&#8221; a soaring expression of female empowerment, which Voegele describes as &#8220;a motivational, uplifting song about dealing with situations rather than trying to hide from them.&#8221; &#8220;One Way or Another&#8221; is an edgy rocker about romantic victimization, while the punchy &#8220;<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 /><st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Chicago</st1:place></st1:city>,&#8221; she says, &#8220;is a metaphorical representation of any kind of escape, about just needing to get away. The line at the end of the chorus is, &#8216;I&#8217;ll be on the seven o&#8217;clock to <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Chicago</st1:place></st1:city>,&#8217; so it refers to a specific city, but it&#8217;s universally applicable.&#8221;<br/><br/>While the concerns Voegele touches on in her songs are contemporary, her sensibility is deeply rooted. Growing up surrounded by the music of seminal singer/songwriters like Carole King, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell and Eric Clapton, thanks to her musician father, Voegele absorbed everything she heard as if by osmosis, and began writing her own songs at 15. &#8220;It&#8217;s my personal goal to continue the standard set by those before me,&#8221; she says of her timeless approach. &#8220;No matter how a song develops, my main goal is to reach people, because there were so many musicians who spoke to me, and still do, to help me to deal with situations. It\'s so easy nowadays with all the technology for people to fake it. For me, it&#8217;s just so important that the true musical talent and passion for the songs be there.&#8221;<br/><br/>Voegele, a Cleveland native now in her sophomore year at Miami of Ohio, is no neophyte; indeed, before she&#8217;d finished high school, the youngster had notebooks filled with songs and was regularly performing live with the poise of a veteran. Kate was 16 when some rough demos she&#8217;d recorded with her father led to an opening slot at a stop on John Mayer and Counting Crows&#8217; 2003 shed tour, followed by second-stage appearances in front of Patty Griffin, Aimee Mann and Mindy Smith. She subsequently opened for Dave Matthews, the Wreckers, Howie Day, John Mellencamp and Jamie Cullum, as well as performing at two consecutive Farm-Aid concerts, Summerfest, SXSW, CMJ and dozens of club shows at venues including New York&#8217;s Bitter End and the House of Blues in Chicago. Additionally, her song &#8220;I Won&#8217;t Disagree&#8221; took first place over 4,000 entries to the New York Songwriters&#8217; Circle, winning Pop Song of the Year, while &#8220;Only Fooling Myself&#8221; was the winner of the USA Songwriting Contest. One early admirer from the A&R world asserted that Kate could be &#8220;the commercial Patty Griffin,&#8221; in reference to the emotional and intellectual depth of her writing and singing. <br/><br/>Ambitious by nature and powerfully motivated by these gratifying early experiences, Voegele continued to write, including collaborations with pros like Jim McGorman (Michelle Branch) and Peter Zizzo (Avril Lavigne), and to record, working up a set of impressive demos in L.A. with Altman in 2004, marking the beginning of what has turned out to be a fruitful partnership. Inevitably, the music Voegele was turning out caught the ears of a number of A&R reps and label heads, leading to showcases and a number of offers, none of which felt right to the canny and discerning young artist. But after meeting with the staff of MySpace Records at the request of A&R man Jon Pikus, who&#8217;d wanted to sign her during a previous stint at Columbia, Kate knew she&#8217;d found the right label to partner with.<br/><br/>&#8220;When I walked into MySpace, I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect because the label was just starting out,&#8221; says Kate. &#8220;But the atmosphere was really cool and so different from the other labels I&#8217;d been to, a lot of which were cold and intimidating. MySpace wasn&#8217;t like that at all. Tom [yes, the original &#8220;friend&#8221; does really exist; Tom Anderson is the site&#8217;s co-founder and the president of the label] and Jon were really easy to talk to, and right away I felt comfortable there. The icing on the cake was that everything about the label was something I felt was right for me. I&#8217;d been looking for a label where I&#8217;d have artistic freedom and where they&#8217;d appreciate the music in its original form and not try to make it anything it wasn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s what I found at MySpace, along with an innovative approach to marketing, which is something I didn&#8217;t see at any other label. The people at MySpace are taking an approach that&#8217;s really different, and I&#8217;m excited to be part of it.&#8221;<br/><br/>Voegele signed with MySpace in October of 2006, choosing to work once again with Altman. &#8220;She met with me and said she was talking to Jon at MySpace,&#8221; the producer recalls. &#8220;I love the idea of MySpace&#8212;I think it&#8217;s a great marketing platform&#8212;and I knew Jon would allow Kate to pursue her artistic vision, which had really evolved over the last couple of years, so I told her I&#8217;d love to produce her record.&#8221;<br/><br/>Soon thereafter they went into Track Record Studios in <st1:place w:st=\"on\">North Hollywood</st1:place> where Emmylou Harris had cut a number of classic LPs, and laid down 12 tracks live off the floor in a three-day burst of sustained inspiration. Among the A-list players who worked on the project (drawn by the strength of Voegele&#8217;s songs, according to Altman) were guitarists Dino Meneghin (Liz Phair, Ani Difranco, Broussard) and Michael Chavez (Sarah McLachlan, Mayer) Eric Robinson, bass player Jonathan Ahrens (Rosie Thomas, Warren Barfield), drummer Aaron Sterling (Liz Phair) and percussionist Chris Lovejoy (AM, Charlie Hunter Quartet), with the renowned Niko Bolas (Neil Young, Fiona Apple, Rachael Yamagata) engineering.<br/><br/>&#8220;Kate is a pop artist, but she has much more soul and integrity than the word &#8216;pop&#8217; would suggest,&#8221; Altman observes. &#8220;Her music is organic and has a strong lyrical perspective with a lot of emotional currency to it. It&#8217;s so refreshing to hear a female artist as young as Kate is who has such a deep perspective as a writer. She&#8217;s got it, and I think this record is pretty special.&#8221;<br/><br/>Poised, beautiful, armed with unforgettable songs and a voice to match, Kate Voegele is poised on the brink of something big indeed.</span>',0,'',0,''),(1474,1840,'New Professionals',1,66,'www.myspace.com/newprofessionals','123 you wish','9173340613','\r\n',1,'',0,''),(1476,1843,'Sub Rose',1,71,'www.subrosemusic.com','','','Jason Jones, vocalist has written and recorded music with many\r\ndifferent artists.

They are no Barbie girls, no wobbly Avril Whibley. No, your Little Mermaid is about to trade in her tail and not for no pink assed Daisy guitar. They are chained to the Rawk now and like the siren voiced Evanescence these sisters (plus one guy) in sonics are doing it for themselves. You can&#8217;t grow up in Ajax , the corner suburb of Sum 41, Not By Choice and Protest The Hero, and not learn how to give it and give it hard. It&#8217;s a battle hard town named for a battle hard ship. Sure they&#8217;re gurls and they have a soft side, velvet pajama parties of cuddlecore and it peeks into the songs. Just remember Princess Riot wear the pants. They ain&#8217;t playas but they have your number, don&#8217;t look to this band to shine at the Mallmart coffee slinging McJob routine, work until your womb takes you to the tomb, Daddy calls the shots until he hands your hand over. Thanks but no thanks. Princess Riot know the road to Dreamville is as pitted as Highway 66, they know it doesn&#8217;t even go all the way&#8230; but they are taking it because what is the point of being a girl in the 21st century if you can&#8217;t. What is the point of girl power if its merely token power. Were the Spices just cute or was there a message in their tedium. The songs of Princess Riot take chances so PR follows. The O.G. of Riot Girlz, Kim Deal of Sonic Youth, the Babes In Toyland, L7, they are the ladies in the Princess&#8217;s posse. They are the Godmothers of the Riot. The Made It aunts. These Princesses are not looking for love, they are expecting respect and when you hear their songs you will agree they can also expect success. Just remember it will be on their terms. The line up consists of not your average everyday Joes, but intriguing characters you may find quite animated. Fronted by the band you have the demonic cheerleader Lindz Riot taming the lead vocals and bass guitar. Her partner in crime and the child of punk Val Knox who knows how to rock the old skool vocals and guitar. There\'s also the electric Jules with her youthful attitude and almost-ADD shining through in the guitar she writes and plays. And with not much to say, but making up for it on the drums you have the bashful Darcy. Combining all their forces together they believe that with each song comes a new story to be told that should rock to the fullest. They will not quit until they have something epic. They will not rest until they have music fans leaving the venues with a catchy tune in their head and a starvation for more candy flavoured rock. With every band comes a journey and quite a few stories to be told from every adventure. For the 5 years now this band has been together they have quite abit to put onto their musical resume. Their biggest achievement so far with the most memorable stories is playing the Vans Warped Tour in 2005 in Quebec City, Quebec and then again in 2006 in Barrie, Ontario. In 2005 they were discovered in one of Toronto\'s rockhouses by producer Joel Kazmi. He took this project into the studio to record a 3 song demo which is a sample of what&#8217;s to come so far. They have plans to record a full album together by the end of 2007. Also in 2005 Daisy Rock guitars discovered these scraping by musicians and were awesome enough to sign an endorsement deal.

I write about serious things, but with the music we make fun of it and make light of it.&nbsp; My lyrics complement the music that Howard and Kee write perfectly.&#8221;\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>&#8220;Things I Hate About You&#8221; captures the musical and lyrical vibe of the band to a &#8220;T.&#8221;&nbsp; Stephanie&#8217;s vocal is immediately engaging, telling the tale of her relationship with her former roommate, a small town girl, who, as Stephanie recounts, &#8220;started working at a fashion magazine and started to change.&nbsp; She dumped her old life and who she was so should could accomplish things.&#8221;&nbsp; And as that first verse ends, the song explodes into a Kee&#8217;s guitar and Howard&#8217;s drums, supporting and expanding upon Stephanie&#8217;s immensely catchy and melodic chorus.\r\n\r\nKee&#8217;s ominously sensual guitar and keyboard riffs highlight &#8220;Before It&#8217;s Over,&#8221; a lament of an off and on and off again relationship.&nbsp; As Stephanie says, &#8220;I wrote about a past relationship that never ended, even though I thought it was kaput.&nbsp; He promised that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.&nbsp; It was all one promise after another broken promise.&#8221; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>The beauty of Rotten Cheri is that they are the perfect mixture of lightness and darkness &#8211; dark enough to have depth and resonance that one can sink into, light and catchy enough that one can forget about the darkness and just sing along to their irresistible melodies and choruses.&nbsp; <br/><br/>The band is now working to take their music and career to the next level &#8211; to an indie label, to music conferences and to film and television.&nbsp; The more that this band&#8217;s music is exposed, the brighter their future will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n',1,'',0,''),(1490,1863,'Clown Sack',1,14,'myspace.com/clownsack','','','\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"color: red;\">Schloppy:<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: red;\">As an infant, Edward Sebastian\r\nMontague, was kidnapped from his parent\'s mansion in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Prague</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\">. The crime was committed by his trusted and loved nanny. The\r\nnanny felt forced to kidnap the young boy, because she did not receive enough money from Mr. Montague to feed her eight children, or pay for her small dilapidated home. She felt it would be easy. After a reward was posted, the nanny would say\r\nshe found young Edward and return him to his parents. However, the plan went <br/>\r\nterribly wrong. Mr. and Mrs. Montague did not post a reward; rumor had it that the couple had thoughts of abortion before Edward was born, but chose not to at\r\nthe last minute. Some say young Edward was destined for great things, for his life had been spared, but the boy\'s parents saw the kidnapping as a blessing so\r\nto speak. The Montague\'s, being incredibly wealthy and focused solely on their\r\nfortune, felt a child was a distraction to them. When the nanny realized that there\r\nwould be no reward, she panicked and left young Edward behind a dumpster at the Gypsy Carnival Circus. With only a blanket and the clothes on his back, young\r\nEdward\'s life hung in the balance. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAs fate would have it, the Circus was in town, performing one more show before packing up and moving to the next city. Edward was found by a young female\r\ncircus performer named </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Alice</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\">. Not knowing where he came from, she took him in as her own.\r\n</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Alice</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> named him Vladimir, after her beloved grandfather. He loved\r\nto sing as a child, because </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Alice</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> loved to sing. He was enraptured with her voice and she sang\r\nto Vlad whenever they were together. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\"></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\">Life was good for Vlad; he was old enough to earn his keep as part of the clean\r\nup crew for the animals. The circus owner nicknamed him Schloppy, because he always had to clean up the sloppy mess made by the animals. Vlad accepted his new name and relished in his work. He would sing to the animals in cages at\r\nnight. Finally, he had something to call his own. Schloppy would watch the circus performers night after night, town after town. He truly wanted to be a clown; he admired the clowns for always being happy, and he too wanted to make people laugh. The only family he ever knew was </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Alice</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\">\r\nand the circus. Schloppy continued upon this path for four more years, until he was eighteen. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOne night after clean up, two drunk and dirty mimes decided to pay Schloppy a visit. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\"></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\">They despised Schloppy for reasons unknown. They threw a burlap sack over his head, and proceeded to beat him unmercifully with a pipe\r\nuntil he was unconscious. He managed to get a glimpse of whom it was, and his heart was forever changed. As Schloppy lay in his own puddle of blood clinging to life, he found himself being transported; on a cart, behind a\r\nhorse, down a bumpy road, he closed his eyes for what he thought would be for the last\r\ntime. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen Schloppy opened his eyes two weeks later, he was surrounded by familiar looking people. These people however were no ordinary group of folk. They were vampires. The vampires made Schloppy an offer he couldn\'t refuse. His internal organs had been damaged during the attack and his kidneys stopped working. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nA man named Necriba asked him, \"Do you wish to die here before your life\r\nis complete or do you want to live forever?\" <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThere was so much more Schloppy wanted to do in life. Necriba explained, that once he became immortal, he would never be able to coincide with mortals, and would have to hide in the shadows forever. Schloppy agreed and became a <br/>\r\nvampire. He continued to travel with a circus of vampires across </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Budapest</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> for several years. He continued to work the cleanup crew, but was eventually\r\nallowed to become a clown in the show, which is what he truly wanted to be. Over the <br/>\r\nyears, he experienced many strange, aberrant, thoughts and emotions. Being a vampire made Schloppy feel very powerful. This was a new feeling for him that\r\nhe had to embrace. Having to prey on mortal humans to survive, he constantly\r\nstruggled <br/>\r\nwith this in his mind. Schloppy was a part of many unusual rituals. The rituals would be unfathomable to a normal human. The images haunted him and\r\nhis emotions became uncontrollable. Schloppy wrote poetry to express his thoughts, and keeps these writings with him always. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nHe yearned to share his thoughts and feelings with someone, anyone! In life he was alone and longed to find others like him. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFinally, his chance has come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p></o:p></span><u><span style=\"color: red;\">ButterCookie:<o:p></o:p></span></u>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"color: red;\"><o:p><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"></span></o:p></span></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: red;\">The sole survivor of a tragic plane\r\ncrash over the </span><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Northwestern United\r\n States</span></st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">, John Prentice Wolfgang VII, was left orphaned and alone in the forest. Left to fend for himself, no one could guess what fate would belie this young child. Some would say fortune shined. Others mutter how God hath no mercy. Either way, young Master Wolfgang was taken in by Keebler elves, and christened\r\nButter Cookie. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nRaised as if one of their own, Butter Cookie enjoyed a typically mundane elf upbringing. Learning the ways of the Elf, and mastering the skills of a baker, he enjoyed life. Working diligently within his thriving community, a young Butter Cookie rose to the top of the Fudge Stripes Production Division.\r\n<br/>\r\nIt was from there the pseudo elf became one of the leading developers for the elves. In an attempt to make a super sugar cookie, tragedy struck for a second time. The main test kitchen tree was burned down and the elder elf was\r\nkilled in a horrific fire which will live forever in Elf lore. Horribly disfigured, Butter Cookie was sent into exile and never returned to the forest.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nWith no experience in the humanized world, a grotesque Butter Cookie sought refuge in the circus. Working as a clown, he was able to hide his deformity and\r\nfind a niche in society. Butter Cookie delighted in the life of a circus clown and found plenty of time for his new love, the guitar. The other circus <br/>\r\nperformers disliked this, because they felt musicians were the lowest form of entertainers. Butter Cookie ignored the rebuffs of his fellow troop, and continued in his pursuit of music. One day while jamming through a red hot </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> tube amp, some loose hay caught fire. The fire spread\r\nthrough the caravan, killing three and maiming seven. Butter Cookie was driven from the circus and blackballed from the clown community forever. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nButter Cookie drifted from job to town like snow on a windy day. Smelling of&nbsp; smoke, and terrified of a world in which he would never belong, he reached an end of sorts in </span><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Southern Louisiana</span></st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">. Lying drunk in the gutter, J. P. Wolfgang VII, <br/>\r\nwould take his final breath. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nEXCERPT TAKEN FROM THE MIND OF BUTTER COOKIE <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLestat moved swiftly and softly spoke to me, \"You are a Wolfgang\r\nyes?\" <br/>\r\nI could only look into his eyes feeling both an intense elation combined with a\r\nfear I have never felt. I guessed at who he was and replied, \"Yes, John\r\nPrentice Wolfgang.\" \"Your family once did me a great service.\" Lestat spoke. \" I will offer to repay it now. Do you want to live forever?\" <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter meeting Lestat, Butter Cookie toured with the famous rocker as a roadie and later as a guitar tech. He was easily able to assimilate into the crazy smoke, mirror, and hallucinogenic ensemble that is rock-n-roll. Where else\r\ncould <br/>\r\na horribly disfigured Elf/Clown/Vampire fit in? Always lurking in the umbra, the thing once known as John Prentice Wolfgang, learned all it could about the music. Feeling confident, Butter Cookie set out on his own to find a group of&nbsp; guys that he could really relate to. Some would say fortune shined.

The clowns took him under their wing and toured </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\"> in the \"Kamchatskaya Oblast Circus\". Slappy learned\r\nvery <br/>\r\nquickly in the art of clowning, and the name \"Slappy\" was bestowed\r\nupon him by his new found family. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThings were looking up for the happy clown, until he discovered the dark secret of the K.O. Circus. It was early 1850, when the troop decided to make Slappy a full member. Ring Leader Kasyanov had the other clowns bring Slappy to the center of the big top. As the other performers watched, Kasyanov revealed his true form as a vampire. Slappy turned to seek help from his clown family, but to his frightening discovery realized everyone in the circus revealed themselves as well. He now knew what the initiation into the family <br/>\r\nreally was. The Ring Leader sank his teeth deep into the frightened clown\'s neck and started draining the life out of him. Kasyanov was extremely strong. Slappy, getting weaker by the second, couldn\'t stop what was happening. He believed death was upon him. Then the taste of warm blood filled his mouth and throat, warming his entire body. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen Slappy woke two days later, it felt like his insides were coated with razors, and the hunger was unlike any he had ever experienced. The wagons moved in the daylight. He was trapped. The wagon contained only a coffin filled with earth and a cage filled with living rats. He helped himself. Slappy knew the scam now, keep traveling through </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\"> preying on all the unsuspecting little towns. The troop was feeding on <br/>\r\nweak humans, who wanted to watch the circus, see the clowns, and laugh. Slappy was sickened by this and wanted no part of it, but at this point there was no alternative. In order to survive, he did what his masters said and fed on the leftover humans to keep from going insane from the hunger. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis went on for two years until one night in late 1852, he overheard his clown family talking about the night they found him, and how they killed his true family. This enraged Slappy, but he knew he must wait for the right time to strike. In a small town called Alexandrov, Slappy developed a plan of attack. Once a month, the vampires like to have a special feast. <br/>\r\nThe unread performers dress in mime costumes, and feed on caged victims captured in a past show. In Alexandrov, the troop put on a free evening show for orphan children, At the end of the show, the children were rounded up and put in cages for the feast. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSlappy saw many haunting things in the previous two years, but this crossed the line. Wile the vampires dressed in their Mime costumes, Slappy entered the tent and threw back the tarp covering the cages. The children screamed and cowered to the back wall of the cage. Slappy put a finger to his clown lips and made a shhhhhh sound. He told the children he was here to help. Astonishing, the children listened and became silent. Slappy ripped the locks off with his bare hands and told the children to follow him quickly, but be very quiet. After Slappy led the children to safety, he went back to the tent. No one <br/>\r\nnoticed the children were missing. He poured lamp oil over the sides of the tent, on the tarp, and anything else that could have lamp oil poured on it. Slappy finished the job, ran out of the tent, and hid to wait for the others to enter. As the mimes funneled into the tent, he counted them. All present, but the Ring Leader. From the tent came a commotion. Slappy <br/>\r\ndecided he couldn\'t wait for the Ring Leader, set the tent on fire, ran, and stood in front of the tent door holding a wooden stake in each hand. Most of the vampires burned to death and the few that tried to make it out received a stake in the heart. After the slaughter, Slappy went to the Ring Leader\'s wagon to end this once and for all, but Kasyanov was nowhere to be found. Slappy went into the wagon and opened a huge trunk <br/>\r\non the right of Kasyanov\'s coffin. Inside, hundreds of gold watches, earrings, rings, all types of jewelry and coins glittered. It was all the spoils of all the innocent humans that were brutally killed over the years. After filling his pack as much it allowed, Slappy headed North and never looked back. To this day, whenever Slappy sees a mine, he can\'t help but think that its Ring Leader Kasyanov. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSlappy made his way to Saint-Petersburg, traveling at night and ducking into cold dark places during the day. From there he moved to Kemijarui </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Finland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\">, then </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Bergen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Norway</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\">. During this time\'1850\'s national consciousness waxed strong in the wake of the French Revolution. Furthermore, economic <br/>\r\ngrowth in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Norway</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\"> stimulated cultural development in music. By the 1860\'s, Slappy studied music with Ludvig Mathias Linderman and Halfdan Kjerulf. The clown/vampire seemed to be a natural in the string area, it could have been a vampiric gift from Kasyanov, or just a talent he never tapped into before. In the 1870s and 80s Slappy was working with Norwegian composers Edward Grieg, and Johan Svendsen. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOne night during a concert in 1888, Slappy saw mimes entering the concert hall. The audience started freaking out. These mimes didn\'t look normal; they looked evil. Slappy knew the day would come when the Ring Leader put <br/>\r\nanother group of blood suckers together and hunted him down. The mimes dowsed the audience and walls with a flammable liquid, and lit it all up. Luckily for Slappy, he helped build the hall and knew where all the passages were. He grabbed Svendsen and pushed him thru a trap door and got him to safety. The rest of the audience died that night in a huge blaze. Hopefully, Kasyanov believed that Slappy died as well. He gathered all the valuables he could carry and chartered a ship to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">United Kingdom</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\">. Then the clown hopped another <br/>\r\nship to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=\"color: red;\">. Slappy stayed in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">Dublin</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=\"color: red;\"> until 1912, then moved to Southanton where he met Wallace Hartley. The clown answered an ad for a bass violinist. Fortunately, Wallace mistook him for a man named Clarke; a renown bass <br/>\r\nviolinist. Wallace needed to get a band ready for a cruise ship traveling to </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">New York</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=\"color: red;\">. This was to be the biggest and fastest ship ever made,\r\nnamed Titanic. Slappy believed this would be a great opportunity to get further away from his past and start over in </span><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">North\r\n America</span></st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">. The plan; take Clarke\'s identity until reaching </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style=\"color: red;\">New\r\n  York</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=\"color: red;\">, then disappear\r\ninto the huge city. Once <br/>\r\nagain, Slappy packed his things. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nDuring the voyage, feeding wasn\'t a problem. A few years back, Slappy discovered that one of his inherited vampiric abilities; he could survive on beer instead of blood, but only for a few months before requiring a blood transfusion. When the Titanic hit the iceberg that night, Gigantic was playing in the Grand Ballroom. All the other musicians fell to the floor, <br/>\r\nbut Slappy didn\'t miss a beat. It was four hours until the crew realized how serious the damage was and started evacuating. The evacuation was quite insane. All the passengers were panicking, so Slappy and the other band members stayed in a group. Then Slappy had an idea, taking out his violin, <br/>\r\nhe started to play. The other musicians quickly joined in. Time went on and the end was near, the last song they played was \"Near My God to\r\nThee,\" then the band shook hands and separated. Slappy never saw his fellow band members\r\nagain. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter the ship disappeared into the cold dark ocean, Slappy headed Northwest. By using his vampiric abilities, he was able to run very fast on top of the water by night and rest under the dark ocean during the day. To this day, Slappy has no idea how long he was out there, because by the time he reached <br/>\r\nthe shoreline his hunger for blood and beer he was borderline insane. He fed on the first living thing he came across; the rumor is, it was a mime. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the event that almost took his life, Slappy decided to go underground\r\nand stayed until 2005. While underground, he could hear things on the surface like people talking, weird mechanical sounds, and construction, but there was one thing that really got his attention. There was a strange music that he never hear before; he liked it, but it seem to be missing a bass sound. Slappy listened to this band for about two months and started to imagine bass lines for each song. Then finally one day, he re-entered the top side and met the guys that were making this interesting music. Slappy surfaced, walked to the <br/>\r\nhouse where the music was coming from, and knocked on the door. The music stopped and the door opened. To Slappy\'s surprise three clowns stood before him in full gear. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe clowns said, \" Hey man, if you\'re here to try out for the bass playing\r\njob you got it, because you are the only one to show up\". <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the first practice with Scratchy, Schloppy, and Butter Cookie, the songs came easy for Slappy. He already had the bass lines in his head from listening to them practice for the last few months. <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nIntroducing Clown Sack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n',1,'',0,''),(1495,1872,'Deep Rising',1,76,'deep-rising.com','','631-766-6925','<body>Formed as a recording project in 1998, Deep Rising has evolved into a rock band with a prog edge featuring excellent singing, playing, and song writing that draws from influences as varied as Stone Temple Pilots, Kings X, Alice In Chains, Rush, Jane\'s Addiction, Peter Gabriel, Seal, Led Zeppelin.

I had a vision for this record and finally there was only one cook in the kitchen.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kelley has independently partnered with manager Debbie Wilson of Wilspro Management to market and distribute the new material in a unique way. On June 6th, the album made a very successful pre-release launch on iTunes that lifted Kelley to the #1 position among all iTunes folk artists. On June 13th, \"Just Say the Word\" boasted a #27 position on iTunes Top Albums. In addition, a series of headlining club dates kicked off on May 28th in Las Vegas at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino and Kelley will continue to tour throughout 2006 in support of the album. \"This is my rebirth,\" Kelley noted, \"I am ready to explore new and different ways of getting my music out there and go to the next level.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Almost Honest,\" Kelley\'s last release, received wide acclaim from critics. Entertainment Weekly praised the CD for being \"soulful, folk-informed, and unflaggingly melodic.\" People Magazine called Kelley, \"the real deal, a genuine talent who brings sincere emotion to his straight-forward pop rock.\" And, Good Morning America dubbed Kelley \"a breakthrough artist.\" The CD topped the Billboard New Artist Chart upon release and had been on the iTunes home page for several weeks.</p>\r\n<p>The first single from \"Just Say The Word\" is the infectious \"Pop Game,\" a song that allows Kelley to comment on American pop culture and his place in it: \"I was sitting at my girlfriend\'s house in LA, chillin\' - when I grabbed a celebrity magazine sitting on the table - showing John Q. Public how the stars live and how much easier life is as a celebrity. I put the magazine down and turned on the TV, only to find the E! Channel showing lives of the rich and famous. I realized that our modern culture is hypnotized by the consumption of simple pop culture pleasures. Make no mistake, I\'m not knockin\' it &#8211; I\'m a sucker for the pop game just as much as the next person, and would love to live in it as a huge star. But the song, \"Pop Game,\" is not about my life in music, but rather about our modern day obsession with the world of popular culture.\"</p>\r\n<p>The title track, \"Just Say the Word\", is a song that deals with the frustrations and memories of past love and also features an encore at the end of the album. Josh speaks about the track: \"Just Say the Word\" is a last attempt at letting a past lover know that they are not forgotten, and that they are still loved and safe in friendship, even though it\'s time to make the next step in the direction of moving on with your life. I chose an encore for the song, because I love the track and the way it makes me feel, and because a lot of my favorite albums have an encore that bookends the record. It\'s a message that just needed to be revisited. And what better way to engrave the title track message than to have an encore.\"</p>\r\n<p>Working with people like the Matrix and Robert Randolph in the past, Kelley decided to keep his collaborators local this time around: \"I worked a great deal with my younger brother and our mutual friend, Dave Haywood. This was important to me because these two musicians are in that early, untainted stage of their promising writing careers. Their type of no filter attitude was just what the doctor ordered.\"</p>\r\n<p>Just as \"Almost Home\" presented so many different musical styles, \"Just Say the Word\" continues to establish Kelley\'s wide range of musical ability and tastes. The listener can enjoy the soulful and deep \"How the Story Goes\" to a stripped down, almost bluegrass \"Bound to Keep Movin\'\" to the pop-driven \"Pop Game.\" Whatever the situation, Kelley proves with \"Just Say the Word\" that he is committed to stretching himself creatively in order to present a varied array of musical and personal expression: \"I believe a great artist is an eternal student. Most of the songs on the record were inspired from sights and sounds that I had heard when traveling the world for the last 2 years. Keeping my eyes and mind open to all facets of information kept me constantly inspired with new ideas and a reinvented perception of life and love. People will say that you can never stretch yourself too far, but I think that\'s ridiculous. There is a certain point in stretching yourself creatively where you lose the reason you got into it in the first place. I\'ve overstretched myself on multiple occasions - alienating my friends, family and lovers from my life. Now, if I want to have something to write about, I try to live true.\"</p>\r\n<p>Josh Kelley has maintained a high media profile over the last several months, appearing on the Emmy Award-winning NBC talk show Ellen, performing on Good Morning America and delivering a soulful rendition of the national anthem at NASCAR\'s Sony HD 500 as well as the home opener world champion Chicago White Sox game. He performed most recently on ESPN\'s Cold Pizza, and is scheduled to perform on CBS Saturday\'s Second Cup Caf&eacute;, August 5th. The touching title track of Almost Honest was also featured in the March 30th episode of the hit series \"Smallville.\" Kelley will also be featured in the digital soundtrack for the hit TV show \"Scrubs.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kelley broke through in 2001 on Hollywood Records with \"For The Ride Home,\" an album that showcased his no-nonsense expressiveness and disarmingly genuine delivery. These qualities were exemplified in the top five smash \"Amazing,\" and follow-up top ten hit \"Everybody Wants You.\" In early 2004, he left Oxford, Miss. for Los Angeles where he interacted with fellow songwriters and players, further refining his skills while determining where he wanted to take his music next. It all culminated with the sessions for his second Hollywood Records album, \"Almost Honest.\"</p>',0,'',0,''),(1511,1893,'Circuit Theory',1,74,'www.circuittheorymusic.com','','','The music of Circuit Theory has been described as dark, inward looking, and rustic.

The story of Johnny Panic so far is enough for a 110 page screenplay let alone an 800 word press biography. <br/><br/><br/><br/>We haven\'t got time to get into all the gory details now, so let\'s just get the salient details out of the way first. While still at school Rob Solly (vocals, guitar, songwriting) met Jonny Shock (drums, drinking, comedy) on a bus in south east London bonding over a shared love of music and they\'ve been playing together ever since. A few guitarists later they struck gold with Matt James who they found right on their own doorstep and after the amicable departure of long time bassist and friend Nash Francis they drafted in Sean Mannion (Rob: \"the most natural musician out of all of us\"). <br/><br/><br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from the glorious history of artists that have meant something in the last 50 years of rock and roll, any triangulation of where they\'re coming from would have to include The Clash, Guns n Roses and the early American punk scene (they\'ve covered The Nerves/Blondie and The Ramones to spectacular effect). <br/><br/>In 2005 Johnny Panic released their debut \'The Violent Dazzling\', an album of stadium sized hooks and melodies wrapped around concerns of mental health, prostitution, drugs and prisoners of conscience. A typical quote from Rob at the time went thus, \"There\'s an ethic missing from a lot of bands\" he explains. \"We live in a society that refuses to question. That\'s where rock \'n\' roll comes in. We\'re not here to shove them down people\'s throats, but every single one of our songs is trying to get something across.\" <br/><br/>It &iacute;s the sort of record that makes much more sense in a post-\'American Idiot\' and \'Welcome To The Black Parade\' world. Of those that heard it, many fell for the passion and scope of the likes of \'Burn Your Youth\' (subject: young male suicide) and \'Automatic Healer\' (prostitution), however the record labels inability to get their head around what the band had delivered coupled with some dark financial shit meant that the album never really stood a chance. <br/><br/>They managed to extricate themselves from their record label but it was a blow that would have KO\'d lesser bands. Many will be surprised to hear Johnny Panic are about to come out fighting again. <br/><br/>But then front man Rob Solly, knows a thing or two about fighting. From the age of 14 he\'s been practising Tae Kwon-Do, reaching a level that found him competing in the US and Australia, he\'s also done Thai Boxing in Thailand and trained in Brazilian Ju Jitsu and boxing as well. The last two years have found Rob training and fighting in mixed martial arts - yes, that\'s Ultimate Fighting Championship and Cage Rage stuff to uninitiated. In fact Rob\'s first paid fight is on September 30. <br/><br/><br/>It\'s fair to say that he\'s in pretty good shape which probably helped when he was hospitalised with septicemia, a complication brought on from peritonitis (which, lest we forget, was enough to finish Houdini off). Having been rushed to hospital four times to be cut open and have parts of his damaged intestines removed, the thick scar running down his abdomen is the only tell tale signs that things have not always been so rosy. \"I lost three and a half stone in three weeks because they were feeding me through a tube in my neck\". Struck down while on tour in Aberdeen, the rest of the band would come visit to keep his spirits up. \"Septicemia is incredibly painful, you\'re basically poisoning your own body, but that\'s nothing compared to having Jonny sitting on your wound bag and sending all the fluid straight back onto the wound. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn\'t been in charge of my own morphine drip.\". <br/><br/><br/><br/>Its being able to maintain a sense of humour about things and this fighting spirit that found the band not giving up. Scoring a British Arts Council grant to travel and play at this years South By South West festival, winning ten grand from the Windows Live Spaces competition and covering The Turtles \'Happy Together\' for NPower\'s 2006 cricket sponsorship. All of this helped keep the band afloat and enabled them to self finance the recording of their second album, inevitably and appropriately called \'The Good Fight\'. Rob even collared Biffy Clyro and Therapy? producer Chris Sheldon in the street and talked him into producing and mixing the record. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Head and shoulders above their debut \'The Good Fight\' is the sound of a band hitting the ground running. One hell of a comeback, key to it\'s success is the emergence of Matt James as one of the most distinctive guitarists in the UK. Hype? Check out the solos on \'Stay\' and \'M-19\' for the evidence, or just listen to the whole album. First single \'Dislocation\' is an anthem to frustration with a refrain of \"Boredom turns me on\", while rumbling bass, squealing guitars and shouted backing vocals explode the tightly wound tension at the heart of the song. Musically the album is broader that its predecessor and along with the aforementioned influences The Stooges (\'Gone\'), Green Day (\'Never Me\') and Morrissey (\'Heroes Of Villains\') get at least a nod. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Rob\'s lyrics are once again a mixture of the personal and the political, but whether it\'s a Colombian guerrilla movement or a dig at those that turn thugs into folk heroes it\'s never forced down your throat. \"I like to think of it as amazing songs, with depth if you want it\" says the front man. After everything the band has been through to get to this point they\'ve got an album that sounds amazing, their goal now is to get the music out there to as many people as possible, to keep writing and playing the music that matters to them, basically to keep fighting The Good Fight.

Art Kirkendoll, virtuoso lead guitar player, and James have been friends for years. They wanted to build a music project that had a chance for lasting success. Rob Slahck, a classically trained bass player, joined Local Stranger in 2003, and with a singer/drummer the three piece band enjoyed some marginal success for over a year. They had to let the original drummer go due to personal issues. In December 2004, Ron Voll was asked to join the band as a drummer. Rick Gillis entered the studio about 2 weeks later, and he completely blew the room away with his voice. Rick&rsquo;s presence all but guaranteed Local Stranger&rsquo;s future success. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith the newly revamped line-up, the magic began to flow. Local Stranger was quickly given the opportunity to play in a few of the larger clubs, and struck gold with an appearance in Club Wars VI. As round one began, only five originals had been written; the show at The Grand Emporium was Local Stranger&rsquo;s second gig. They played well enough to secure a spot in the next round. A blistering Semi-Finals performance netted a slot in the finals at The Beaumont in June, 2005. While Local Stranger came in 3<sup>rd</sup>, they won the praise of the General Manager of The Beaumont, which turned out to be every bit as good as winning Club Wars outright. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuly 2005, after only 7 months together, the four musicians entered the studio to produce their debut CD &lsquo;In The Shadows&rsquo;. The studio crew raved at Local Stranger&rsquo;s talent and professionalism. Recording was done over a mere three week period. The final mix was completed early October and the CD was released on October 26. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn August, 2006 Local Stranger introduced Joe Bergen as their new bass player. He has been a very positive addition, bringing years of experience and professionalism to the band. Drummer, David Park joined their band in February 2007. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br />\r\nWe&nbsp;were one of twenty bands selected from Canada, the USA and Mexico to perform in Las Vegas, NV for the Live Indie Rock Wars.&nbsp;&nbsp; April 25-27, 2008.&nbsp; Kansas City&#39;s very own Local Stranger is proud to announce they finished the finals in the top 10.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith our original lineup&nbsp;in place we will be working our way&nbsp;back to the studio to complete our second CD.<br />\r\n&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n</font>\r\n',1,'Rick Gillis - Vocals, Keyboard<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt Kirkendoll - Guitar<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRobyn Slahck - Bass<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRon Voll - Drums \r\n',0,''),(2224,2413,'LIGHTNING HAND',1,105,'http://www.LightningHandBand.com','','','<font face=\"Verdana\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formed in 2004, LIGHTNING HAND is a Blues-based Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll band from Sacramento, CA.

HAVING FUN, &ldquo;GOOD-TIMES&quot; &amp; CHERISHED MEMORIES not &ldquo;THROW YOUR GUN&rsquo;S IN THE AIR YOU N&rsquo;S B&rsquo;S &amp; W&rsquo;S, &amp; SPANK &ldquo;DAT&rdquo; _ _ _ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou may be asking yourself &quot;why is he trying to change something that no one cares about&quot;. Good question. First, I CARE &amp; I grew up &ldquo;old school&rdquo; where there wasn&rsquo;t any software to make you sound good. Second, we here at Weezie Productions are sick of the degrading, no class, disgusting language &amp; racial overtones in this industry today. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know I may sound a little negative, but there is good music&hellip;no, there&rsquo;s GREAT music out there, you just have to find it. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not always easy to find, based on what radio is forcing us to listen to.<br />\r\nYou have to go to the internet, live shows, and local club &ndash; get out and see, live, and breath music as it was meant to be.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe we&rsquo;ll even see a change in society!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what if you&rsquo;re fat, short, over 16 years old, too tall, got one leg and a kick stand&hellip;Can You Sing without technology helping you sound perfect?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYES! Fans, there is software out there that you can sing into and it will make the worst of singers sound good, so the next time you throw your money at the next exciting flavor radio pushes on you. Think to yourself, how much is really coming from the artist and how much is coming from the software being used AND is it worth paying $100.00 or more for a ticket to see it in concert.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m not implying that we here at Weezie Production have the best voices in the world, but you can bet your life it&rsquo;s real and natural. All we ever use is a mic to get the music to you - which was how it was done when it all made sense and made a difference in our lives. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe want to get back to music for people who want songs with meaning, a feeling, soul, and fun. <br />\r\nEven though we will never see another Luther Vandross Weezie Productions refuses to add to the insanity that&rsquo;s making it to mainstream radio. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe all have to die doing something with our time, and this is how we plan to spend our time. We&rsquo;re giving the 30-40-50 year olds there options back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy and we appreciate everyone&rsquo;s continued support. Tell everyone you know to check it out and support Weezie...We can&#39;t do it without you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope you feel good by the end of the CD and want to listen to it over and over again. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWeezie Productions was founded in 2005 and is focused on new artists with a positive message.

In both her writing and performance, Williams demonstrates her raw and inspiring experience of survival and determination that drives her to create original, empowering material. Each song, like a separate chapter, unfolds a story of continual hope and courage, moving each listener through her lyrical exposure of emotion.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With a new CD in the works, scheduled to be released in February 2008, and a tentative tour booked throughout Europe for fall 2008, Williams is steadily moving forward.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No stranger to the music industry, Williams impressed American Audiences at the 2002 Nashville Tennessee Country Music Alliance Awards where she proudly walked away with the Most Outstanding Showcase Entertainer of the Year Award as well as the Most Promising Female Artist of the Year. Williams has also shared the stage with the Guess Who&rsquo;s Donny McDougal &ldquo;Follow Your Daughter Home,&rdquo; and accompanied famous country star Chris Ledoux&rsquo;s band for a performance at Nashville&rsquo;s Tootsies Bar.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Williams&rsquo; exceptional and energetic performances on stage have taken her across Western Canada striking casinos, rodeos and countless clubs with her powerful presence, including the Main Stage at both the Calgary Stampede and the Edmonton Klondike Days.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Manitob born, but now a B. C. girl followed a gypsy lifestyle of movement from a young age and turned to music as a way of grounding herself. As a passionate singer and songwriter, Williams preaches the potential of sound and voice as a healing medium and gains her musical influence through lending a hand to others that need support during their own hardships. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;I have been writing since I was about 10 years old and loved singing as far back as I can remember.

IT BLEW MY SOCKS OFF! It combines 3 of Jessie&#39;s own songs, fabulous whether you love country or not and proof that Jessie is not just another country singer, but a multi talented singer in her cover of Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks with &quot;Dreams&quot;, a song we all love and done with unrivalled comparison to the original. Closing with a more traditional arrangement this CD is proof of a very wide range of talents in Jessie and would without hesitation give it 5 stars! It just leaves you wanting more!&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>The Indie News Network Newsletter - Kyle Kissman </em></strong>- &quot;She does an excellent version of Amazing Grace. Your heart will melt at the, oh-so, sweet sound.&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em>Bjarne C. Hesselbjerggaard - Country - Action Show, Radio Sindal, Denmark, BJ the DJ Show on TWANGTOWNUSA Web Radio - </em></strong>&quot;The Other Side of Town, a five song CD on Canadian singer/songwriter Jessie Williams. Once I got my hands on this CD, the frontpage photo first caught my attention, for obvious reasons. So I said to myself: Can this Lady sing ?? Shame on me. She&acute;s great! What a voice, and what a great sound on this CD!! And talking about Jessie&acute;s songwriting. I must admit - her own songs are the best on the CD.

He taught himself to play piano by ear starting at the age of 16. He used his talents to record several local demos to submit them to record companies. After working with a few of the local known rock bands, musicians and recording studios, he sought to form his own home based recording studio to create and compile his own home demos. Once the internet became the fashion for independents to release and market their own music, Jim jumped on the bandwagon to do the same with his own.</span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\';\"><br class=\"webkit-block-placeholder\"></span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\';\">He recorded and released his first full length album, \"The Only One\", Ã‚Â in 2005 along with the #1 SoundClick pop/rock singles \"The End of the World\", \"All Because of U\", and \"Hey Diddle Dawn\". Ã‚Â Another popular ballad that reached the top 20 SoundClick charts was \"Stay With Me\", which also received airplay on Joe Kelley\'s \"Upper Room\" on 88.5 FM in Fairfield, CT.</span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\';\"><br class=\"webkit-block-placeholder\"></span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\'; \">In 2006, Jim began recording and working on his sophomore album \"Scorpio\" which was released in the Spring of 2007. The album continued in the tradition of the debut album with strong pop/rock based songs as well as deep, personal ballads. This album also marked the debut of Jim\'s guitar playing, which he is continuing to teach himself as he did with the piano.</span><br></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\';\"><br class=\"webkit-block-placeholder\"></span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'times new roman\';\">In the Summer of 2007, Jim was searching the internet and accidentally Google\'d a website that would pique his interests. He discovered author and poet Geoffrey Dicker and found his work to be as imaginative as his own music. After contacting Geoffrey and a few trial demos were composed, a mutual agreement was made and the two creative forces were hard at work on a 3rd album for Emmons. \"In The Absence of Red\" is by far the most inspired, stunning and in-depth work Jim has created to date. With the help of Geoffrey\'s lyrical poetry, each song tells a story of love and loss, hope and happiness, future and fornication that can only be portrayed the way Jim has imagined it to be. The album\'s strong hooks, deep lyrical alchemy, and catchy beats are a strong indication that the world is about to discover a whole new hybrid of pop/rock/jazz flavored music.</span></div>',0,'',0,''),(2411,1000152,'Gary Ramsey',7,NULL,'','217 stony point rd.','704-734-1219','I come from a small mountain town in North Carolina,but I have traveled the U.S. from coast to coast,sometimes as a roadie for national acts and sometimes jammin out myself.I am a singer/songwriter/musician that just wants to do what I enjoy most...ROCKIN&#39; OUT!

Darren&#39;s mother, Lois Faye, was the lead singer of The Waylighters, a popular touring band in the 70&#39;s. A young Farris was never left out of the band. &quot;Oh yeah, I really had little choice but to love music,&quot; Farris explains, &quot;There was always practicing, writing music, and musicians [coming] in and out of our home.&quot; </font>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana,geneva\">Farris describes being raised in a rock band atmosphere. &quot;Music was just all around me - acid rock, power-pop, country, and even spiritual. My mom was playing during some pivotal changes in pop music, so I was exposed to all of that,&quot; Farris says, &quot;Every time a new single would be hot on the charts, we would have to rush out to the record store and pick up the 45 (rpm record). They would play them over and over, until they got it down.&quot; </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana,geneva\">After being raised the first five years of his life in the heart of Chicago, moving to the more rural setting of Tennessee gave Farris a wide cultural perspective to draw from. &quot;Yeah, I have always had to deal with the &lsquo;duck out of water syndrome&rsquo;,&quot; Farris says of an early childhood of moving from place to place. About 70 miles outside Memphis, Darren was heavily influenced by the wide array of music being pumped out on the Memphis airwaves. He writes about the glory days of cutting school to hang out with local blues session musicians such as Alabama Smith on the world famous Beale Street. &quot;I had this very small circle of friends and we were all into rock and roll and understanding the roots of it [rock music]. We did so many crazy things, it&#39;s a wonder I am here to tell the story,&quot; Farris muses of a storybook-like wild youth, including anecdotes of his growing up years and adolescence in the autobiographical song &ldquo;Part of Something&rdquo;. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana,geneva\">Darren&#39;s new album &ldquo;Psychopathic Issues&rdquo; is a testament to always taking the road less traveled and not looking back. &quot;It was actual therapy for me, no pun intended,&quot; laughs Farris, as he describes his experience writing the album. Consisting of thirteen guitar- and lyric-driven tracks, it completes what he describes as an &quot;audio-ography of the past 10 or so&quot; years of his life. &quot;I find it very difficult to write about things that I haven&#39;t experienced first hand, so I really have little choice but to write about my life situations,&quot; Farris says of his songwriting process. &quot;I think that is actually why people seem to get drawn to this album,&quot; Farris continues, &quot;It all comes from real places, about real people, written at real points of raw emotion.&quot; </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"verdana,geneva\">Starting the journey with the adrenalin-pumping &quot;Nobody But You&quot; and ending with a guitar-smashing, cinematic remix of the debut single &quot;Jenna&quot;, &ldquo;Psychopathic Issues&rdquo; blends just the right elements of powerpop and mainstream pop/rock to secure a musical grip on the listener&rsquo;s mind. This collection of stinging guitar and lyric-driven works is sure to be quintessential to any enthusiast&rsquo;s collection. Farris is banking on his &ldquo;Psychopathic Issues&rdquo; to be the right prescription for an ailing rock and roll radio that is undernourished and in dire need of a new and exciting sound.</font> \r\n</p>\r\n',0,'',0,''),(2435,1000198,'Cruel Noise',1,68,'http://www.cruelnoise.ch','Hubstreet 23, CH - 9500 Wil','+41 79 750 70 62','Cruel Noise is a Swiss Rock/Punk Band that was \r\nfounded back in 1998.

It ranges from mid-tempo broodings to fast-paced electronic assault. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbracing Tragedy <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArchitectural Demise is also a blistering catharsis, an embracing of the ills of life. They exist, they happen, they must be accepted, assimilated and confronted. Thus, Architectural Demise. The music is a reflection of the shadows of life. It is both a universal consideration of the human condition and a personal response to Acid&#39;s own life. &ldquo;I would have to say most of my influence comes from my life and the events that I have encountered therein that led me to an aggressive stance. My music is an expression of my being and state of mind when tragedy or tragedies have presented themselves in front of me, both in present and in past.&rdquo; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Artist at Work <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcid is always writing new music. He&rsquo;s a busy songwriter with lots of aggression to turn into expression, much to the giddy delight of snarl-grinned fans, no doubt. A new album is in the works, more good cheer for industrial-heads. &ldquo;The album I am working on right now will be titled &ldquo;Malfeasance.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s set for release early in 2008. Acid is currently working with A&amp;R Select, the world&rsquo;s leading independent artist development firm, based out of Los Angeles, CA. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Architectural Demise&rdquo; is both an iconic presentation of classic aggro-industrial considerations and a step into the future for the genre.&rdquo; &ndash; A&amp;R Select \r\n',0,'',0,''),(2439,1000210,'7 MILE SCREAM',1,14,'','1006 tiffiany trail','1803-425-6475','We have all played in different bands and sometimes in the same band together.

He has one foot planted in the more contemporary, funky sounds that define today&rsquo;s New Orleans brass band scene; meanwhile, Andrews shows his elders the respect he believes they deserve, as his other foot rests firmly in the music&rsquo;s time-honored traditions. &ldquo;Traditional jazz, the way it was played 100 years ago, is dying out with my generation,&rdquo; Andrews says. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not about to let that happen.&rdquo; By combining the old with the new, Andrews has created a unique sound, one that is currently captivating New Orleans music fans. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAndrews certainly possesses the pedigree to carry this illustrious New Orleans musical flame. Growing up in the historic Treme section of the city, one of the first black neighborhoods in America, Andrews was immersed in the thick of New Orleans culture from the get go. Musical legends like Earl Palmer, James Black and George Lewis once walked his neighborhood&rsquo;s streets and played in its clubs, as do some of today&rsquo;s young lions, such as Nicholas Payton, Kermit Ruffins and Shannon Powell. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKnown by locals as the &ldquo;Sixth Ward,&rdquo; the Treme still hosts &ldquo;Second Line&rdquo; parades on most Sundays, with brass bands and dancers rambling through its bars and streets. These unique, celebratory occasions have been taking place in this neighborhood for at least a century. Into this scene came Glenn David Andrews, eager to soak it all in. &ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to grow up anywhere else.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nChances are that whatever band is leading one of these parades (the ReBirth, Li&rsquo;l Rascals or the Newbirth Brass Band), a few of its members will likely share the same last name: Andrews. This family is currently producing highly talented young musicians at an astonishing rate. Glen David&rsquo;s first cousins, James and Troy &ldquo;Trombone Shorty&rdquo; Andrews, are local favorites; so are Glen and Revert &ldquo;Peanut&rdquo; Andrews, who both hold court with the ReBirth Brass Band. Since he began playing his instrument at age 13, Glen David has performed with almost every brass band in the city. His boisterous voice and warm trombone style are fixtures on the streets, and he adds his own flavor to whatever band he is supporting that day and always makes it sound better. Now he is stepping out on his own, ready to take New Orleans music up from the streets and bring it to the rest of the world. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis ability to add new songs to the brass band repertoire is matchless for a performer so young. Songs like &ldquo;Knock with Me, Rock with Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Show Me How You Do That Dance&rdquo; are not only street favorites, but have also received sizeable commercial radio airplay, an honor that has eluded brass band music since the ReBirth Brass Band recorded its signature tune, &ldquo;Do Whatcha Wanna,&rdquo; almost 20 years ago. &ldquo;I am writing all the time, and my lyrics just come out of me,&rdquo; Andrews explains. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the way it should be, because this is heart and soul music.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAndrews is becoming a full-blown star in New Orleans, and his powerful vocals and soulful trombone playing recently drew attention at the Louis Armstrong &ldquo;Satchmo Summer Festival&rdquo; as well as on the stage of the local music shrine, Tipitina&rsquo;s. &ldquo;People are starting to take notice,&rdquo; Andrews observes. &ldquo;I know how to take charge of a stage.&rdquo; One minute he&rsquo;ll have you feeling the solemn power of an old time spiritual from the 19 th century, and the next you&rsquo;ll be jumping higher in the air than you ever thought possible while chanting at the top of your lungs. This seamless mixing of styles sets Glen David Andrews apart from his contemporaries. Through his music, he brings musical history to life, while also creating a new sound that is all his. \r\n</p>\r\n',1,'',0,''),(2455,1000244,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1,'',0,''),(2456,1000247,'Suicidal Poets',1,71,'http://www.myspace.com/suicidalpoets','62 Avenue F, Lodi NJ 07644','201-674-6247','<font color=\"#800000\">CHECK OUT OUR FEATURE ON THE NBT PODCAST...NextBigThing!!!<br />\r\nHear 2 tracks from the band, plus intros &amp; insights from Michelle!<br />\r\nGo to:<br />\r\nhttp://nextbigthing.libsyn.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthen, VOTE for the Podcast at &#39;Podcast Alley&#39;, and help to keep the show rated in the Top 10 Podcasts, at:<br />\r\nhttp://www.podcastalley.com/podcast details.php?pod id=2966<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHANKS!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuicidal Poets are Notorious for their Poetic Lyrics and Musical Originality. They are a crossover between Folk, Rock, Pop, Alternative. The Suicidal Poets launched onto the Internet music scene April 1999 and that was like Opening a Window to the World. Since then it has been an upward spiral of success. The band has been featured as the ..1 hottest undiscovered rock band on the MTVundiscovered site. Their music has been included on several compilation c.d&#39;s including the highly acclaimed compilation c.d with artists such as Brad Pitt, among others. Their unique eclectic style of music which ranges from pop rock to gothic folk. Led by lead singer Michelle and bassist Carmelo, who write the band&#39;s music, they have even caught the attention of major producers like Lewis A. Martinee, who produced artists such as Vanessa Williams, Enrique Iglesias and The Pet Shop Boys, to name a few. They have been featured as the hottest unsigned song in the pop rock and alternatve charts on Yahoo Music and many other sites. Why this name? It&#39;s a combination of reasons. It started with the song &#39;Suicidal Poets&#39;. Then one night, Carmelo was playing so furiously that he ripped the calluses off his fingers, and started bleeding all over the stage. That made the name stick! The band has played in many of the top clubs in New York City and Northern New Jersey, with the occasional Boston road trip....Venues include: The Bitter End , Knitting Factory, Kenny&#39;s Castaways, Arlene&#39;s Grocery, Manny&#39;s Carwash, Images, Rosie&#39;s, Babe&#39;s Place, Orphan Annie&#39;s, Fibber Magee&#39;s, The Blue Room, Limerick House, Blaggards, and The New York State Festival, to name a few.

Conceived from the ether of the Los Angeles skyline and christened in the underbelly of the Hollywood music scene, Stex Jebba is comprised of four musical entities that could not be more different. The founding members, Brett (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Dub G (lead guitar), El Hombre (Bass), and Ron (Drums), each contribute a musical perspective distinguished by their past and focused through their collaboration. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn their own personal musical journeys, the members of Stex Jebba, both individually and collectively, have had engagements with catalysts of creativity from the realms of rock, hip-hop, metal, punk, pop, jazz, classical, electronic, 80s, cassette tape, record, CD, 8-track, breathing, growing, hating, yelling, fucking, eating, sleeping, and of course... funk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has inspired a brand of music that transcends traditional definition. Many, including The Jebba themselves, have described their style as funk; however, to them, funk is freedom. It holds the least amount of boundaries and for that, they love and embrace her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir aversion for popular protocol extends beyond the creation of music and spills over to their live performance.&nbsp; A no holds barred charge of unbridled energy is released in full force when Stex Jebba takes the stage.&nbsp; Nothing is reserved.&nbsp; Armed with a catalogue of hard hitting originals and an arsenal of popular covers spanning many genres, Stex Jebba is ready and waiting to take on any venue or audience with full passion and confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a distinct musical style and an imposing stage presence, Stex Jebba is committed to fall into league with the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Funky Meters, and Rage Against The Machine while embracing the gusto of Guns N&#39; Roses.

Whatkind of soul?  According to songstress Cherine Anderson, this soul is unlikeany other, for it is <strong><em>Dancehall Soul</em></strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext\">, &ldquo;a mixture of reggae, dancehall,soul and R&amp;B, truly incorporating the grittiness of my past with the sweetness of the things to which I have been exposed.&rdquo;  In this modern dayparade of glamour, glitz, and unmerited superstardom, Cherine truly embodiesstar-like qualities. She is a triple threat: singer, songwriter and acclaimedJamaican actress, having starred in two of Jamaica&rsquo;s most successful films, <u>DancehallQueen</u> (1997) and <u>One Love</u> (2003).  Cherine has been focusing herattention on writing music and collaborating with industry giants like Sly&amp; Robbie, David Norland (Madonna, Dallas Austin), JeekyMan (Lil Kim), aswell as prominent Jamaican producer Christopher Birch (Shaggy).  She recentlycollaborated on remixes with Wyclef Jean and ex-Beatle member Paul McCartney. Reggae and urban radio stations in Jamaica, the US, Canada, several Europeancountries, as well as internet radio have already fallen for the sweet voicespilling from their systems courtesy of her debut hit single &ldquo;Good Love&rdquo;. Cherine quickly followed &ldquo;Good Love&rdquo; with a lover&rsquo;s rock duet with Chuck Fendawhich quickly topped both the singles and the video charts in Jamaica. Cherine&rsquo;s latest release, &ldquo;Kingston State of Mind&rdquo;, provides her perspective onthe realities of the environment in Kingston and illustrates the songwriting depth that lies in this young artist.  Cherine also took on the challenge ofdirecting the music video for &ldquo;Kingston State of Mind&rdquo;. The video topped the Jamaican video charts as well as peaked MTV Tempo&rsquo;s Cross Caribbean videocountdown, and was eventually retired from the countdown after spending animpressive four months in the top ten.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext\">It is important to note that this profoundtalent did not emerge overnight.  Born in Rockfort in East Kingston, Jamaica,her parents Derryck &amp; Barbara Anderson kept Cherine and her two oldersisters in Sunday school and any other church activity that would keep them off the unstable streets.  It was in church that her musical talent was discovered.Cherine explains, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so much the message in the church songs thatappealed to me at first&hellip;it was the passion and strength of peoples&rsquo; voices.&rdquo;  At the age of 12, she became a touring member of Ashe Performing Arts Ensemble,one of the Caribbean&rsquo;s most successful performance companies, and receivedprofessional training in dance, music and theatre. In 2003, Cherine combined her two loves, singing and acting, starring in the film <u>One Love</u>.  Hervoice lent two heartfelt songs to the film&rsquo;s soundtrack, and her acting talentearned her the MTV2/Urbanworld Film Festival Award for best actress in afeature film. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext\">One would think that nothing else could possibly fit into this seemingly superstar equation, yet there is more.  Notonly does this young woman possess talent, beauty and class, but Cherine isalso a highly educated, intelligent young woman as well.  Having graduated withhonors from the prestigious Middlebury College with a Bachelor of Arts in Filmand Music and a minor in Japanese Language and Literature, Cherine continuouslyraises the bar for herself in every aspect of her life.  During her collegecareer, her passion and dedication to her craft led her to acquire numerousinternships at entertainment companies such as MTV Networks, Interscope Recordsand the Chris Blackwell owned Palm Pictures and Palm Records.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Tahoma Small Cap\'; color: windowtext\"><strong>&ldquo;The world needs tohear more reggae and dancehall from a female&rsquo;s perspective.</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Tahoma Small Cap\'; color: windowtext\"><strong>I feel blessed tohave such great legacy set by Bob Marley, Shabba,  etc&hellip;</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Tahoma Small Cap\'; color: windowtext\"><strong>But I want to be apart of the female movement out of Jamaica</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Tahoma Small Cap\'; color: windowtext\"><strong>that makes a similaror even greater impression on the world.&rdquo;</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: windowtext\">According to reggae legend Sly Dunbar,&ldquo;Cherine is the real deal.

As if brought together by the cosmic forces flowing through the universe, The Wonderland Avenue is a collaboration of individual concepts and ideals. It is a combination of taste, talent, and many influences. The Wonderland Avenue consists of drummer, Aric Garcia,21; keyboardist, Gerardo Larios, 24; guitarist and primary vocalist, Isaac Routh, 22; lead guitarist and vocalist, Michael Roy Kelley, 26; acoustic guitarist, Nick Meyerson, 22; and bassist, Ross Fife, 23.	<span><br /><br />The Wonderland Avenue, excluding Gerardo who is originally from Mexico City, grew up in the small town of Humble, Texas. Isaac, Nick and Ross have played together since their freshman year of high school. It was not until their migration to Austin, Texas, that the band joined forces and combined their creativity into what is now The Wonderland Avenue.<br /><br /></span></span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #545454; font-family: \'Lucida Grande\'; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px\">Developing their sound by combining classic and progressive influences with natural musical talent, The Wonderland Avenue has created their own signature style of rock. With their clever, lyrical arrangements and edgy, psychedelic sound, these young men are building quite a following and raising the bar that rock music has been waiting for. In the fall of 2007, the band released their first professionally recorded EP entitled &ldquo;Inizio&rdquo;. The self-produced EP was recorded in downtown Austin, Texas at 5th Street Studios and will be the catalyst for their musically-orchestrated explosion.</span>&nbsp;<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>',1,'<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: \'trebuchet ms\'; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: small\">Michael Roy Kelley-Lead Guitar and Vocals<br />Isaac James Routh-Rhythm Guitar and Vocals<br />Nicholas Meyerson-Acoustic Guitar<br />Gerardo Larios-Keyboards<br />Ross Fife-Bass<br />Aric Garcia-Drums and Percussion</span></span></span>',0,''),(2472,1000283,'Craig Maxim',6,106,'http://www.SouthernMischiefBand.com','','','',0,'',0,''),(2473,1000285,'Johnny Gobbs',1,68,'http://www.johnnygobbs.com','','512-963-4120','',1,'Jason-Guitars<br />\r\nRob-Bass, vocals<br />\r\nRamsey-Drums&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\r\nKerby-Vocals\r\n',0,''),(2474,1000286,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1,'',0,''),(2475,1000288,'Fumble',1,68,'http://www.fumblerock.com','Walkalone Records / Ruoholahdenkaty 8 / 00180 Helsinki / Finland','','<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal\">Fumble is a melodic punk rock band from Helsinki, Finland.

Mann who\r\nare both located in the US. In late 2005, these two combined forces\r\nafter &lsquo;meeting&rsquo; each other on Usenet in the alt.guitar newsgroup.\r\nInitially, it was just an effort to refresh their playing skills and\r\nlearn a little about home recording, but they quickly realized it could\r\nbe much more. From it&#39;s humble beginnings, Project-43 would go on to\r\nbecome one of the first bands to record, mix, produce and release a\r\nmusic CD completely over the Internet, with none of the members ever\r\nhaving met in person. All while being separated in three difference\r\ncountries and five locations around the globe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Charlie and Steve established the groundwork, the two soon\r\nenlisted the vocal talents of Antti Heikkinen from Finland. Antti gave\r\nthe project a truly special touch that made the music come together\r\nlike never before. His vocal talents should have landed him a major\r\nrecording career long ago, thus eliminating any chance he could be part\r\nof the team. But, for whatever reasons, the stars were aligned and he\r\nwas available for the project. That was a very fortunate set of\r\ncircumstances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe band then added Scott Wallace who is located in Scotland, to play\r\ndrums and replace the canned &lsquo;loops&rsquo; or programmed drums that had been\r\nused to this point. This also brought a whole new dimension to the\r\nmusic and the overall sound of Project-43. Christopher Bell-Boudreaux\r\nis the latest talent to join Project-43 adding his unique NYC guitar\r\nstylings and talent to the mix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo date, Project-43 has created over forty original Rock &amp; Roll\r\nsongs that have an amazing quality that would challenge even the best\r\nindustry professionals to know that these people have never played in\r\nthe same room together. Their debut CD, &ldquo;Silence the Quiet&rdquo;, released\r\nin 2007, contains a collection of tunes in the hard/heavy rock genre.\r\nTheir new follow-up CD, <strong>&quot;Ticket To Infinity&quot;</strong>,\r\nreleased in March of 2008, also contains a bit of a mix, but is\r\ncertainly more &#39;metal&#39; and modern. The combination of these two CDs\r\nmakes it easy to see why their slogan, &quot;Project-43: The Future of\r\nClassic Rock&quot;, may be more truth than marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n',1,'<pre>\r\nDee Heikkinen:  lead vocals, guitars\r\nCharlie Wardick:  guitars, bass, vocals\r\nSteve Mann:  guitars, keyboards, vocals\r\nScott Wallace:  drums, percussion\r\nChristopher Bell-Boudreaux:  guitars\r\n</pre>\r\n',0,''),(2528,1000490,'Our Lunar Activities',1,71,'http://myspace.com/ourlunaractivities','20 Gress, isle of Lewis, Scotland, U.K, HS2 0NB','+44 (0)7909 548 872','Our Lunar Activities were formed by brothers Kevin and Charles Clark.

It was on the back of this show OLA agreed to put an E.P out on Scottish label Neon Tetra. &ldquo;It comes in waves&rdquo; was released in February 2007 and again received praised reviews with journalists picking up on the bands stadium sound and anthemic choruses. A short film for this release was made by the band themselves and paid homage to their love for seventies exploitation movies.

That plan was redefined as Rich was brought in on bass, and Peekaboo. With numerous packed-venue shows out of the way, and an amazing 5 song EP recorded and distributed, Somatic has already proven that it is not just a typical bar band. Although their EP &quot;Plan B&quot; packs quite a punch, it simply does not do justice for their live performances. With extraordinary energy, out of control programming and lights, and general stage mayhem, Somatic always leaves a venue with a lot more friends than they had before the show. A secret can only be kept a secret for so long, and the cat is out of the bag. Somatic is not a &quot;scene&quot; band, a &quot;local&quot; band, or a &quot;bar band.&quot; Somatic is poised to join the ranks with national and internationally touring acts in the near future. Nothing in the music world comes for free, and Somatic has paid their dues. With every member coming from a background of several &quot;could-have-been&quot; bands, and every one of them (including their crew/family) being a working class, day-to-day type of person, no band understands hard work and dedication as well as Somatic.

Everyone we knew were the first ones in line to purchase our favourite bands brand new album. Then everyone we knew all gathered around our stereos turned out all the lights, light our candles, closed our eyes and experienced that album for the very first time. The first listen was always the most serious and analytical by the 5th-7th listen we would already be figuring out the processes, structure&rsquo;s and instrumentation&rsquo;s within those albums. Basically every little detail about the music was analyzed and interpreted. Running our stereos through eq systems to pump or reduce frequencies to magnify small details within the music itself, we would reverse the music and fast forward to find secrets about that album which the engineers and artists always loved to throw into that final master mix. It was these details that we took out of the music which began manifesting Pur Pale into what it has become today musically. But it was through my own interpretation of life&rsquo;s experiences that created the artistic backbone. Through all the self inflected abuse, lieing, selfishness, violence, suicides, drug abuse, non-believer of spirituality or god for lack of physical proof and everything that was The Negative within my own personal past aggravations of life I found the truth within all of these topics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPur Pale is the representation of a sterile mind &quot;pur&quot; meaning Pure and &quot;Pale&quot; meaning white (Pur White). Similar to that time when you couldn&rsquo;t stop your eyes from un-focusing on that one little section of that wall, sucking yourself into a spacey trance of sterile numbness but yet utter comfortably and trust. Talking about topics and issues in which people tend to find uncomfortable, humiliating, terrifying or even things in which people find hard to express in fear of negative critism and judgment. Pur Pale is here to become a part of all our relative natures, we are here for one another to guide as a community of growth and understanding over our independent personal selves in order to better understand the world around us in order to obtain that selfless humanity, We analyze, interpret and communicate from every point of view in all contrasts from every angle. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe start each project with an independent purpose or topic of emotional relativity in which manifests itself from within our daily environments. By the end of the project we have turned that independent purpose of emotional relativity into a globalized feeling but never understanding of the topic itself.

Let me set the record straight... this is NOT an easy CD to\r\nfind. No wonder Heavy Harmonies has no database listing for it.\r\nFurthermore, of all the members who post their collections on that\r\nsite&#39;s message board, I only found Arsin&#39;s Beyond on one or two lists.\r\nIf only collectors like you knew how good this one is. The chorus of\r\nNow&#39;s the Time is like a powerful street drug... it hooks you fast and\r\nkeeps you coming back for more. For anyone who can&#39;t hear the sample,\r\nthis song blasts off with nothin&#39; but the layered, chorus vocals, only\r\nto launch into a commercial, feel-good guitar riff. Highly reminiscent\r\nof K.K. Wilde (with higher vocals and better production) or Lancia at\r\ntheir radio-friendly best. The whole CD is as good as the song you\r\nheard here. Big vocals, hooks hooks and more hooks plus screamin&#39;\r\nguitar solos that will take your breath away. Released in the mid-90s\r\nwhen the hair metal/glam scene was on four flat tires, this band would\r\nbeen the cat&#39;s pajamas in the late 80s or earlier half of the decade.\r\nCollectors who are lucky enough to have this CD cling to it\r\npassionately... the many who don&#39;t are encouraged to take advantage of\r\nthis chance to finally own it.

I didn&#39;t mind dancing without any shyness with any and all girls willing to except the challenge. I surely had the musice bug by the time Wolf Man Jack,&nbsp; The Ed Sullivan Show, &amp; Soul Train activated my alpha-nerves. I started out lip-singing to all the Temptations, The four Tops, Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Marvin Gaye,... and so on and so on. In 1967 moved from Los Angeles to Portland Oregon, took boys chorus glee! and ear training. Learning to play the piano finally was no longer the curse I thought it was, never by daring to touch one, now was an explosive therapy of creative infinity. I practiced feverously for many years, joining jazz communes, getting on the road, with commercial top 40 bands, asking every keyboardist to show me how they do that, and this, until my resource optional lead me to study theory, composition, and harmonics.&nbsp; Soon I was traveling, and creating a working musical history in about a dozen bands, duos, trios, quartets, to 6-10 piece bands playing; Sly &amp; The Family Stone, &nbsp;Chicago Transit Authority, and Buddy Miles, Edgar Winter Bad Company, Jimmy Hendrix, Cream, Led Zepplin, etc. I started out on Hammond B-3 Organ with duo Leslie Speakers, Clavinet, Fender Rhodes, Crumar Orchestrator, Juno M-60, etc. I currently use Korg, Yamaha, and ESQ1, &amp; Sampler/Roland M-C 500/16 channel PA Studio-Master board/1500 Roland Amp/ect.&nbsp; Ideal for MIDI programmable DJ show. I love to kick my own hand bass, and can really kick Jazz keys like Joey D.

R&amp;B, hip-hop, contempory &amp; classic&nbsp;jazz, funk,&nbsp;popspace,&nbsp;punk, and classical. I write and play T.V. and movie themes.

It is\r\nmy passion, my love, my redemption, my strength, and my creation. My\r\ngoal is to work with a label that cares about releasing quality music\r\nand supporting artists to be career musicians, not cheeky\r\none-hit-wonders. Here&#39;s some info about me:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs\r\nan independent artist I have self-recorded and self-released 3 CD&#39;s:\r\n&quot;Demo 2005&quot; (my first demo), &quot;Into The Noise&quot; (my first EP), and most\r\nrecently &quot;The Love Juice Sessions&quot; (my second EP, currently available\r\nfor free download through my website and myspace, physical copy to be\r\nreleased August of 08). I play all the instruments and sing all the\r\nvocals on my albums. I&rsquo;ve booked and played over 250 shows in the last\r\nthree years including two self-funded tours. I currently perform as a\r\nsolo as a one man band, using a loop station that allows me to create\r\nlive loops of guitar, bass, vocals, percussion, keys, and saxaphone\r\ninto layers of sound. My music can generally be described as blues,\r\nfunk, jazz, soul, reggae, latin, and rock. I use no backing tracks or\r\ncd&#39;s of any kind other than a metronome when playing live. I build the\r\nsong piece by piece in front of the audience, often times pulling\r\npeople out of the crowd to give them cowbells and shakers and help me\r\nbuild a loop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve played in many bands in many positions:\r\nguitar, drums, bass, vocals, etc... I am a multi-instrumentalist and a\r\nsinger/songwriter. I love everything from Sinatra to Slayer but my\r\nfavorite music in the world is blues, funk, soul, and rock. I love to\r\nwrite and play all types of music from metal to jazz. And, in no\r\nparticular order, my top 5 bands are Pink Floyd, Dave Matthews Band,\r\nRadiohead, Thrice, and The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Ok that&rsquo;s six.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&#39;m currently booking a fall tour to promote &quot;The Love Juice Sessions&quot;\r\nthat will begin in September and hopefully go through winter.

From the opening note to the first hit on the drums they knew they had something special. First and foremost, there is the music&hellip;each song stands as a mini-drama unto itself, where the bands&#39; varying influences and tastes all magnificently battle with one another for prominence. &quot;We don&#39;t like to do everything in a typical way,&quot; Schaefer says with a grin. &quot;To our way of thinking, each song should be different. We pride ourselves, says Garay, in pushing each other to test our boundaries. That keeps it interesting for us, and interesting for the fans as well.&quot; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey knew from the beginning that they would need a singer who had the range to go from powerful and raw to delicate and emotional. Along came Arrow. He was found singing at an open mic in Las Vegas and was instantly impressive. They recorded him on tracks called &ldquo;Bow Down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drowning Soul&rdquo; and knew they had it. His peaceful warm tone and soulful poetic lyrics \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nbrought their sound to a new level. Writing songs has never been so easy. The other half of the rhythm section, bass guitar player Andy Champagne, was found playing in another band in Las Vegas that happened to be splitting.

The innovative quintet is comprised of Mike Gombas, Chris Kendrick, Shawn Angelo, Vince Gurioli and Ben Meyer. According to singer Mike Gombas, &ldquo;The songs are usually crafted around a melody but they really only become counterfeit molly songs after everyone has a chance to put in their own unique stamp on each and every part.&rdquo; Luckily, it&rsquo;s a process that has worked well for the group over the years.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			After completing hundreds of east coast shows, the band self-released a studio 8 song EP in July 2004 that gained them a loyal cult following, but also led them down the typical road of big label disappointment. Chris Kendrick recalls &ldquo;We got early interest from Neptune&rsquo;s Producer Pharell Williams and various others.&rdquo;<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Against all odds, the self-produced album turned out brilliantly, which landed them the pleasure of opening for national touring acts such as Staind, Jimmy&rsquo;s Chicken Shack, Family Force 5, White Light Motorcade, Tantric, and Seven Mary Three.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Easy to listen to, but hard to classify, counterfeit molly have crossed many genres since establishing themselves with their self titled 2004 debut. The introspection of grunge, the weight of metal, the in your face appeal of punk music all blend easily in their songs.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The band spent the last six months in the studio writing, recording and producing their next album with a fine toothed comb. Songs like &ldquo;I Wanted More&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little White Lie&rdquo; benefit greatly from the band&rsquo;s unparalleled attention to detail has led them to a sound that is singularly unique in a modern day when acts are sorely missing any sense of individuality.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			www.counterfeitmolly.net&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.myspace.com/counterfeitmolly<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Contact: Rob Kendrick&hellip;..757-754-7884<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			</span><span class=\"epksubheading\">Instrumentation<br />\r\n			</span><span class=\"epktxt\">Mike Gombas - Vocals, Guitar<br />\r\n			Chris Kendrick - Guitar/Piano<br />\r\n			Shawn Angelo - Guitar<br />\r\n			Ben Meyer - Drums<br />\r\n			Mike Mason - Bass<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			</span><span class=\"epksubheading\">Discography<br />\r\n			</span><span class=\"epktxt\">&quot;counterfeit molly&quot; (2004) EP<br />\r\n			***radio - &quot;Added Advantage&quot; &quot;Painless&quot;&nbsp; WROX 96.1 96x and WNOR 98.7 FM99.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			&quot;The Eternal Optimist&quot; (2007) LP<br />\r\n			***radio - &quot;I Wanted More&quot; &quot;Blood &amp; Bones&quot; WNOR fm99, WROX 96.1 96x and WXMM 100.5 MAX FM<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			</span></td>\r\n			<td style=\"width: 10px\"><img style=\"border: 0px\" src=\"../img/spacer.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"10\" height=\"1\" /></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n',1,'mike gombas...<br />\r\nchris kendrick...<br />\r\nshawn angelo...<br />\r\nben meyer... <br />\r\nmike mason...\r\n',0,''),(2588,1000732,'The Hex Parade',1,71,'http://www.myspace.com/thehexparade','','','<font face=\"impact,chicago\" size=\"3\">&nbsp; <font face=\"tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The Hex Parade is a 3-piece rock experience that formed by the luck of the draw.

Yet three years and forty some odd original songs later Ethic is stronger than ever, and about to take all those non believer&#39;s by storm. The founding fathers, Steve Pompei and Rick Scarola have played music together since they were kids. Though the line up has changed a few times in the last 7 years, they finally chose Aaron Travers, a bombastic drummer from South Town, whose energy is unlimited and is a meticulous timekeeper. Enter Richard &quot;Rocky&quot; Sundgren, an established guitarist and songwriter in his own right, who 3 years ago had his own band. Pompei&#39;s and Sundgren&#39;s musical lives have run parallel, each supporting the other. Finally 3 years ago, after dismissing their current guitar player due to musical differences, Pompei called in a favor. In 2 weeks time Ethic needed a guitar player to open up for Sebastian Bach at the Webster Theatre in Hartford, CT. Sundgren agreed to fill in. Ironically Rocky&#39;s band Sylt had just disbanded. The gig was so hot Ethic knew they had to have him. He agreed and we have been writing and playing non stop for the last 3 years. This is the final line up. The magic that these 4 souls create on stage and in the studio is stupifying. With Travers timekeeping, Scarola &quot;the maestro&#39;s&quot; technical jargon, Rocky&#39;s emotional riffs and Pompei&#39;s introspective lyrics and melody make this quartet an absolute phenomenon. Ethic is currently in the studio finishing up our third CD, a 13 track masterpiece of highs and lows and heartfelt music that will blow your head off.\r\n',1,'Steve Pompei - Lead vocals<br />\r\nRocky Sundgren - Lead guitar<br />\r\nHarry Masterbone - Bass guitar<br />\r\nAaron Travers - Drums\r\n',0,''),(2606,1000815,'Melucines',7,36,'','','','',0,'',0,''),(2607,1000818,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1,'',0,''),(2608,1000819,'Lokixximo Music',3,86,'http://www.myspace.com/lokixximo','','201-577-6891','<strong><span>Lokixximo is New York&#39;s next, poised for success and co-signed by the&nbsp; industry itself,&nbsp; their street buzz is immaculate with a&nbsp; tremendous following for over three years.

It began after Will&#39;s former band THIRTEENTH STONE disbanded. &quot;I still needed an outlet for my writing and it only works with music.&quot;, Sabo said.Upon realizing Thirteenth Stone was coming to an end Will went back to his roots, back to New Orleans for a brief sebatical. He found his old spiritual guru(if you will), an old moon-shine making, herb growing coon ass named Roscoe Cane.In a drunken stupor, the new vision came to light. The new name was found and the new band would shine. He decided to name the project after his mentor, with a variation on the spelling. This change was followed by the addition of Terry Davis(a seasoned professional) on lead guitar and what was once important to the Thirteenth Stone would be important again. The stories that Will tells in his songs complimented by a swampy new sound on guitar, not to mention being fueled by the hard drinkin&rsquo; ways of old. The next addition after several changes in the position was Jimmy Vinci, formerly of another local band, Factory Black, on bass. Jimmy brings in a smooth compliment, vocally, to Will&#39;s &quot;whiskey soaked&quot; rasp. Jimmy could be fronting his own project, but he believes in ROSCO CAINE as much as anyone. With the addition of Jimmy, the stage show&#39;s intensity was brought up a notch. Deciding that one more change was needed, Thirteenth Stone drummer, Jimmy Willis, was brought in. Jimmy and Will worked very well together, so it was only a matter of time. Jimmy plays with an intensity and focus, that set the pace for a very cool ride. Hooky originals, a nice ecclectic selection of covers, and a kick-ass live show can mean only one thing.The boys are back so keep an eye out , they will take you so far back in the bog, you might not ever make it out.<br />\r\nWhether you like independent original rock or the classics of the seventies on up to the modern music today, RoscoCaine is a band you should check out !Guaranteed to get your asses movin&#39;, with a little swamp-music-ass- whoopin&#39; \r\n</p>\r\n',1,'Will Sabo- Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar<br />\r\nJimmy Vinci- Bass, Vocals<br />\r\nTerry Davis- Lead Guitar<br />\r\nJimmy Willis- Drums \r\n',0,''),(2638,1000895,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','',1,'',0,''),(2644,1000911,'KHAMA',3,18,'http://WWW.MYSPACE.COM/STARROFTHASOUTH','P O BOX 5635 W HOLLYWOOD, FL 33083','754-422-4320','<a href=\"http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u191/KHAMARECORDS/khamabio.jpg\">http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u191/KHAMARECORDS/khamabio.jpg</a> <br />\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37801167\">http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37801167</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37706161\">http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37706161</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37800748\">http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37800748</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37584618\">http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=37584618</a><br />\r\n</p>\r\n',0,'',0,''),(2645,1000912,'City in the Sea',1,NULL,'http://www.myspace.com/wearecityinthesea','','253 250 6292','<div align=\"center\">\r\n<strong>We are City in the Sea. <br />\r\nWe love making music. <br />\r\nHope you enjoy listening to it!<br />\r\nWoo!</strong> \r\n</div>\r\n',1,'<div align=\"center\">\r\n<strong>Jason, Blake, &amp;&nbsp;Jeff.</strong> \r\n</div>\r\n',0,''),(2648,1000917,'Rockirovka',1,71,'http://I-Aliev.narod.ru/','','','&laquo;Ð¥Ð°Ñ€Ð´ Ð¸ Ñ…ÑÐ²Ð¸&raquo; Ð³Ñ€ÑƒÐ¿Ð¿Ð° &laquo;Ð Ð¾ÐºÐ¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ°&raquo; Ð±Ñ‹Ð»Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐµÐ½ÑŒÑŽ 2005 Ð³Ð¾Ð´Ð° Ð˜Ð³Ð¾Ñ€ÐµÐ¼ ÐÐ±Ð´ÑƒÑ€Ð°Ñ…Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ñ‹Ð¼ Ð¸ Ð’Ð»Ð°Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð¼ ÐŸÑÑ‚Ð½Ð¸Ñ†ÐºÐ¸Ð¼. <br />\r\nÐÐ° Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾Ñ‚ÑÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¸ 2005-2006 Ð³Ð¾Ð´Ð° ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¸Ñ€Ð°ÐµÑ‚ÑÑ ÑÐ¾ÑÑ‚Ð°Ð²: Ð² Ð´ÐµÐºÐ°Ð±Ñ€Ðµ 2005 Ð³Ð¾Ð´Ð° Ðº Ð³Ñ€ÑƒÐ¿Ð¿Ðµ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ÑÐ¾ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ð½ÑÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð±Ð°Ñ€Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½Ñ‰Ð¸Ðº Ð”ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ ÐšÐ¸Ñ€Ð¸ÐµÐ½ÐºÐ¾, Ð° Ñ‡ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ Ð¿Ð¾Ð·Ð¶Ðµ ÐºÐ»Ð°Ð²Ð¸ÑˆÐ½Ð¸Ñ†Ð° ÐÐ½Ð°ÑÑ‚Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ ÐÐ±Ð°Ñ€ÐµÐ½ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð°, Ð² Ð½Ð°Ñ‡Ð°Ð»Ðµ Ð¾ÑÐµÐ½Ð¸ 2006 Ð±Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑ‚ Ð•Ð²Ð³ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ Ð“Ð»Ð°Ð·ÐºÐ¾Ð².<br />\r\n<br />\r\nÐ’ Ñ‚Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð¼ ÑÐ¾ÑÑ‚Ð°Ð²Ðµ Ð³Ñ€ÑƒÐ¿Ð¿Ð° Ð°ÐºÑ‚Ð¸Ð²Ð½Ð¾ Ñ€Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ‚Ð°ÐµÑ‚ Ð½Ð°Ð´ Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð°Ð»Ð¾Ð¼ &ndash; Ð³Ð¾Ñ‚Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‚ ÐºÐ¾Ð½Ñ†ÐµÑ€Ñ‚Ð½ÑƒÑŽ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾Ð³Ñ€Ð°Ð¼Ð¼Ñƒ.
