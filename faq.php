<p><strong><u>Why did you change the competition?</u></strong><br />
    <strong>Our goal  has always been to maximize the promotion of independent artists.&nbsp; The original premise of the Life Underground  Tour was to promote and expose as many bands as possible.&nbsp; However, with the recent downturn in the  economy, sponsorship funds are getting harder and harder to find. Rather than  postponing the event we opted to streamline. We&rsquo;ve waived the registration fee  and&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve lowered our sponsorship levels  to maximize the number of sponsors while still giving them the same value.&nbsp; A break in a brutal economy for them leads to  additional funding for you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
   </strong><br />
    <strong><u>New Overview </u></strong><br />
  The Life Underground Tour is broken into 2 rounds of voting. In the first round  of voting, November 15th &ndash; December 15th, all registered bands will be vying  for a position in the top 20. All voting will be performed by registered users  of Best of Bands. There are no  judges, therefore the bands that get their fans and peers to vote the most will  move forward.&nbsp; <br />
  The success of Life Underground Tour depends on your participation.&nbsp; The  more bands we have involved and the more fans we have voting means bigger  corporate sponsorship possibilities.&nbsp; The more sponsorships, the more we  can accomplish for you! We&rsquo;re a team! We&rsquo;re all in this together.&nbsp; Show your  support to other bands.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all here to bring each other up to the top!<br />
  After the top 20 are selected, promotional CD, consisting of a track from each  of the top 20 semi-finalists, will be distributed nationally to every possible  outlet,&nbsp; including radio, magazines,  ezines, records stores, various lifestyle markets, as well as to military  installations overseas.<br />
  Beginning January 1st the top 10 finalists will submit a video for the Life  Underground Virtual Tour. The Virtual Tour will allow all of Best of Bands users to watch videos from all of our  semi-finalists. During the Virtual Tour there will be additional national  promotional activities on a national level.<br />
  Once the Virtual Tour has been publicized and viewed, the second round of  voting will begin. All of the semi-finalists will compete for the top .  Remember, there are no judges except for your fans. At the end the second round  of voting there will be 4 bands. These bands, chosen by the public, will be  invited to perform live at the House of Blues in Atlantic City alongside a major headliner.<br />
